89
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280
the king of Egypt commanded them but

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750
saved the male children alive

92
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.480
saved the male children alive so the king of Egypt called for the

93
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490
so the king of Egypt called for the

94
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.180
so the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them why have you

95
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190
midwives and said to them why have you

96
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.360

98
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.350

99
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360
children alive because the Hebrew women

100
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.590
children alive because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women for they

101
00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600
are not like the Egyptian women for they

102
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.170
are not like the Egyptian women for they are lively and give birth before the

103
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180
are lively and give birth before the

104
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.500
are lively and give birth before the midwives come to them therefore God

105
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510
midwives come to them therefore God

106
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.350
midwives come to them therefore God dealt well with the midwives and the

107
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360
dealt well with the midwives and the

108
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.600
dealt well with the midwives and the people multiplied and grew very mighty

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610
people multiplied and grew very mighty

110
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.050
people multiplied and grew very mighty and so it was because the midwives

111
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060
and so it was because the midwives

112
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.990
and so it was because the midwives feared God that he provided households

113
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000
feared God that he provided households

114
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.199
feared God that he provided households for them so Pharaoh commanded all his
