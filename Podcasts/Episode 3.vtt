00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.420
Reclaimed the Podcast, where we talk about Jesus,

3
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.160
belief, doubt, and what it means to follow

4
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.600
him today.

5
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.960
I'm your host, and I couldn't think of

6
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.460
a better way to launch this journey than

7
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.480
by diving straight into the heart of faith,

8
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.720
especially what happens when faith is born out

9
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.100
of doubt.

10
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.820
Today, I'm joined by someone I deeply respect,

11
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.820
Dr. James Elliott.

12
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.500
He's a biblical scholar, but also someone who's

13
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.120
been through the valley of unbelief.

14
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.940
James, welcome.

15
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.460
Thank you so much.

16
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.460
It's an honor to be here.

17
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.340
Honestly, if you told me 10 years ago

18
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.780
I'd be on a podcast talking about Jesus,

19
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.480
I would have laughed.

20
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.420
Well, that response definitely hints at quite the

21
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.880
journey, and that's exactly what we're doing a

22
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.820
deep dive into today.

23
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.800
Our sources, they're pretty unique this time.

24
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.160
We're really exploring your own path, the academic

25
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.740
notes, personal reflections, that whole intellectual trajectory from,

26
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.460
well, profound skepticism to faith.

27
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.160
You weren't just indifferent, right?

28
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.700
You were genuinely opposed to Christianity.

29
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.180
What was behind that?

30
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.500
What really fueled that resistance for you?

31
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.080
Yeah.

32
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.080
Opposition is the right word.

33
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.480
It wasn't just casual apathy.

34
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.640
It was a conviction.

35
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.620
You see, I grew up in a pretty

36
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.580
secular home, so religion always felt like an

37
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.460
old story, something disconnected from the real empirical

38
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.300
world I lived in.

39
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.500
Ancient history, sort of.

40
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.020
Exactly.

41
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.760
Then when I got into university, studying philosophy,

42
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.920
then biblical studies, my whole approach was purely

43
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.920
academic, almost forensic.

44
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.700
Analyzing texts?

45
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.100
Right.

46
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.780
Like historical artifacts, looking at them with the

47
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.680
same critical eye as any other ancient writing.

48
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.080
And from that viewpoint, honestly, the claims of

49
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.780
Christianity, especially the big ones about God, miracles,

50
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.200
intervention, they just seemed, well, lacking, intellectually weak.

51
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.600
Were there specific things, like a classic question?

52
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.320
Oh, absolutely.

53
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.820
The problem of evil was huge for me.

54
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.020
How can an all good, all powerful God

55
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.160
allow so much suffering?

56
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.060
That felt like an insurmountable logical hurdle.

57
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.540
I read all the philosophical arguments against traditional

58
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.760
theology, and frankly, they made a lot of

59
00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.340
sense to me then.

60
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.080
I genuinely believed faith was a crutch.

61
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.500
A way to avoid the tough stuff.

62
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.040
Yeah.

63
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.500
A way to avoid facing the harsh realities

64
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.139
of life, rather than a real search for

65
00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.479
truth.

66
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.940
So it wasn't just dismissing it lightly.

67
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.660
It was a deep intellectual engagement against it.

68
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.660
You were really wrestling with the foundations.

69
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.220
Absolutely.

70
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.560
My skepticism felt solid, built on what I

71
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.140
thought was strong intellectual ground.

72
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.420
I studied ancient religions, critical theories about who

73
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.620
wrote the Bible, philosophical critiques.

74
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.100
I felt I had this comprehensive framework that

75
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.380
explained away belief.

76
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.780
Right.

77
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.440
But what I realized much later is that

78
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.780
doubt.

79
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.280
And it's rarely just intellectualism.

80
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.000
Oh, okay.

81
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.400
So there was more going on.

82
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.840
Definitely.

83
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.100
Those questions about evil, about suffering, why God

84
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.000
seems so silent, they weren't just abstract problems

85
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.400
for me.

86
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.520
Looking back, they were deeply emotional, like cries

87
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.900
for answers for justice that I didn't even

88
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.480
recognize as such at the time.

89
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.260
The head and the heart working together, but

90
00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.640
in opposition to faith.

91
00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.280
Precisely.

92
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.500
The intellectual arguments gave structure to the emotional

93
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.900
turmoil.

94
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.620
And together, they built this really strong shield

95
00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.300
against faith.

96
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.400
Skepticism felt necessary, protective even.

97
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.580
That makes a lot of sense.

98
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.780
We do tend to build those intellectual walls

99
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.100
around emotional places.

100
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.100
It's very relatable.

101
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.240
So given that level of skepticism, head and

102
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.560
heart aligned against it, what started to change

103
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.800
things?

104
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.200
Was it one big moment or more like

105
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.000
a slow chipping away at those walls?

106
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.620
It was.

107
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.340
It was both, actually.

108
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.140
And that's kind of key to how it

109
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.980
unfolded for me.

110
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.160
The gradual erosion happened first.

111
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.600
The deeper I went into the biblical text,

112
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.240
even critically, the more I found things that

113
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.200
were hard to just dismiss easily.

114
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.480
Certain narratives, themes, the moral teaching of Jesus,

115
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.120
for instance, the sheer power of some of

116
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.540
the prophets.

117
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.880
They didn't fit your neat categories.

118
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.400
Exactly.

119
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:48.600
They challenged my frameworks.

120
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.620
I started thinking, if this is just human

121
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.420
invention, how does it carry such profound weight

122
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.300
for thousands of years?

123
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.680
But then there was a pivotal moment.

124
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.520
One specific evening really changed everything.

125
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.260
I was doing what I often did reading

126
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.960
the Gospel of John in Greek, actually, looking

127
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.700
for critical angles, inconsistencies.

128
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.420
Usual approach.

129
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.340
And I came across John 14.6, where

130
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.400
Jesus says, I am the way, the truth,

131
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.020
and the life.

132
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.040
No one comes to the Father except through

133
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:16.279
me.

134
00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:17.760
A huge verse.

135
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.500
But you said you'd read it, what, 100

136
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.440
times as a critic.

137
00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:21.660
What was different this time?

138
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.280
How did that academic lens just shift?

139
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.520
Yeah.

140
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.800
Critically, it was just this exclusive, frankly, audacious

141
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.700
claim that needed dismantling.

142
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.060
My brain would immediately jump to comparisons, other

143
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.320
ancient religions, philosophy schools, try to contextualize it

144
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.520
away.

145
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.700
Analyze the Greek words.

146
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.980
Exactly.

147
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.800
Dissect way, truth, life, argue about semantics.

148
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.160
It was all intellectual breakdown.

149
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.400
But that night, I don't know, for the

150
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.740
first time, it didn't feel like a claim

151
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.360
about truth.

152
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.960
It felt like an invitation to truth, capitalized.

153
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.240
The word truth.

154
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.740
It just landed differently.

155
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.100
See, my whole academic life, years in philosophy

156
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.460
history, I was chasing truth, relentlessly, an intellectual

157
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.060
truth seeker.

158
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.780
Driven by it.

159
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.140
Completely.

160
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.340
But it hit me right then, with this

161
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.700
clarity.

162
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.560
I was chasing truth, but I had absolutely

163
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.580
no peace, none.

164
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.740
My head was full of theories, arguments, analysis,

165
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.780
but my soul, restless, no calm, no spiritual

166
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.880
rest in all that thinking.

167
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.460
Yeah, wow.

168
00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.820
And suddenly, Jesus wasn't just offering answers to

169
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:19.460
my questions.

170
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.920
He was offering himself, as truth embodied.

171
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.600
And with him, this promise of peace that

172
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.960
my intellect couldn't even compute.

173
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.280
It felt like that fortress I'd built, brick,

174
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.000
biological brick, it just crumbled.

175
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.000
Not from outside attack, but from within.

176
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.440
Yeah.

177
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.620
Because I suddenly saw it was empty inside.

178
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.180
Yeah, a revelation beyond just reason.

179
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.820
Chasing truth, but never finding peace.

180
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.440
That really hits home.

181
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.640
Your experience sounds so much like Thomas, doesn't

182
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.800
it?

183
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.440
The disciple who doubted the resurrection.

184
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.480
And Jesus, in John 20, he says, put

185
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.120
your finger here, reach out your hand, stop

186
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.020
doubting and believe.

187
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.060
He didn't shame Thomas.

188
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.720
He met him right there, in the doubt,

189
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.500
offering proof.

190
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.200
Do you see that parallel?

191
00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.960
Did Jesus' approach to Thomas resonate with your

192
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.760
own need for evidence?

193
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.480
Oh, absolutely.

194
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.900
Thomas' story became my story, in a way.

195
00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.500
My skepticism, my analytical mind needing evidence, something

196
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.140
I could intellectually touch and see.

197
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.120
That was me.

198
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.320
And like with Thomas, Jesus didn't dismiss my

199
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.580
intellect.

200
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.600
He didn't say, just believe blindly.

201
00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.680
He didn't demand I shut down my critical

202
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.080
thinking.

203
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.580
Instead, it felt like he just patiently, gently

204
00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:22.900
pulled me through the skepticism.

205
00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.320
Not around it, but through it.

206
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.800
Exactly.

207
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.940
It wasn't like, poof, suddenly all my questions

208
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.800
vanished, or every paradox was solved.

209
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:29.280
Not at all.

210
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.720
What changed was more profound, a heart level

211
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.020
shift, an invitation into a relationship.

212
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.640
Realizing the person of Jesus wasn't just history

213
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.080
or data.

214
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.160
He was living, inviting.

215
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.660
And the beautiful thing is, even now, as

216
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.120
a scholar, I still have questions.

217
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.420
The world's complex.

218
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.900
My understanding keeps growing.

219
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.580
But what I have now is him.

220
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.420
And somehow, deep down, in a way that

221
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.040
satisfies the soul, that's enough, more than enough.

222
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.640
It's a piece that supports the questions, rather

223
00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.840
than waiting for all the answers.

224
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.100
That's a really powerful place to land, especially

225
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.900
from where you started.

226
00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.040
The faith isn't about having zero questions, but

227
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.820
about connection.

228
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.860
Emerging from skepticism could lead down many paths.

229
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.660
Why Jesus, specifically?

230
00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.340
In a world full of religions, worldviews, what

231
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.460
makes Jesus unique for you?

232
00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.480
What makes him compelling?

233
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:15.940
Right.

234
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.860
This is the absolute core for me.

235
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.060
The thing that just stands out.

236
00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.020
It's what made Christianity radically different from everything

237
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:22.740
else I studied.

238
00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:26.400
Simply put, because only Jesus dies for you.

239
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:26.860
Okay.

240
00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:27.680
Untack that.

241
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.080
Well, think about almost any other system, religious

242
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:30.920
or philosophical.

243
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.880
At its heart, the message is usually some

244
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.660
version of, do better, try harder, reach enlightenment,

245
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.760
purify yourself, follow these rules, do these rituals,

246
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:42.960
gain this wisdom.

247
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:43.780
Keep effort on us.

248
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:44.400
Always.

249
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.620
The burden is on you.

250
00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.360
Your effort earns your salvation, your peace, whatever

251
00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.080
the goal is.

252
00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.780
But Christianity, with Jesus at the center, it

253
00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.180
just flips that whole thing upside down.

254
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.780
It offers something utterly different.

255
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:55.300
Grace.

256
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:55.920
Exactly.

257
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:56.540
Grace.

258
00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.640
Paul puts it so powerfully in Romans 5

259
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.440
.8, and this verse just hit me intellectually

260
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:00.880
and emotionally.

261
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.740
While we were still sinners, Christ died for

262
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:04.040
us.

263
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.620
Just think about the timing there.

264
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.780
While we were sinners, not after we got

265
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:08.440
our act together.

266
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.280
Not after we earned it.

267
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:09.620
No.

268
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.080
While we were broken, rebellious even, flawed, actively

269
00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:13.860
messing up.

270
00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:17.520
That kind of unconditional preemptive love, you don't

271
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.520
find that anywhere else.

272
00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.860
It's unearned, undeserved.

273
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.800
Jesus didn't just teach truth.

274
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.420
He was truth, and then he became the

275
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:25.980
sacrifice.

276
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.440
Understanding the cross, not just historically, academically, but

277
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.940
personally, as something done for me, to bridge

278
00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.960
the gap my own failures created, well, it

279
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.360
broke me.

280
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:38.860
Broke you.

281
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:39.240
Yeah.

282
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:39.919
In a good way.

283
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.880
Shattered the self-sufficiency, the intellectual pride, the

284
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.020
idea I could earn my way.

285
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.540
And right there in that breaking, it healed

286
00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:46.820
me.

287
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.260
Filled a void I hadn't even fully admitted

288
00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.160
was there.

289
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.540
It's a love that comes before effort, before

290
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.140
worthiness, before being good enough.

291
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.300
That's why Jesus is just radically different.

292
00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.020
It's such a clear, powerful way to put

293
00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:00.140
it.

294
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.920
Not what we do, but what's done for

295
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:02.140
us.

296
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.920
I can really hear how deeply that landed

297
00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.800
for you emotionally and intellectually.

298
00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.680
So thinking about someone listening now, maybe they're

299
00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.680
right in that place you described.

300
00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.600
Wrestling with doubts, big questions.

301
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.080
Maybe they want to believe, but just don't

302
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:13.640
know how to start.

303
00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.680
What would you say to them based on

304
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.260
your own journey?

305
00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.320
Any practical advice or spiritual encouragement?

306
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:18.840
Yeah.

307
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.200
The biggest thing, the most crucial first step

308
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.100
I'd say is start right where you are,

309
00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.020
right now.

310
00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.140
Don't try to fake faith you don't have.

311
00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:26.980
Don't pretend.

312
00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.160
Be completely, maybe even brutally honest with God.

313
00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.920
If you're open to that possibility with yourself,

314
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.200
with safe people.

315
00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.300
Just raw honesty.

316
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:35.880
Utterly.

317
00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.240
If you're angry, say you're angry.

318
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.460
If you doubt he even exists, tell him

319
00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:40.660
that.

320
00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:41.660
He can take it.

321
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.420
Seriously.

322
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.500
Your questions, your frustration, your skepticism, it doesn't

323
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.100
scare him off.

324
00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.140
He actually welcomes the honesty.

325
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.040
It's freeing.

326
00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:51.620
It is.

327
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.320
And Jesus himself gave this incredible promise in

328
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.120
Matthew 7.7. It's been a guidepost for

329
00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:56.720
me even now.

330
00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.540
Ask and it will be given to you.

331
00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.220
Seek and you will find.

332
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.180
Knock and the door will be opened.

333
00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.220
Notice the verbs there.

334
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.480
Ask, seek, knock.

335
00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:06.100
They're active.

336
00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.480
It's an invitation to engage.

337
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.780
Not passive waiting.

338
00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.140
It doesn't say figure everything out perfectly, then

339
00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:11.480
believe.

340
00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.580
It doesn't say resolve every paradox first.

341
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.880
It just says, ask, seek, knock.

342
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.460
It implies a posture of wanting to find

343
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.180
out, a humble inquiry, persistent pursuit.

344
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.620
You don't need the whole roadmap worked out.

345
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.000
You don't need a theology degree.

346
00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:25.720
Just knock.

347
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:26.480
Just knock.

348
00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:28.460
Be persistent with the questions.

349
00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.120
Stay open to finding something and keep seeking

350
00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:31.380
him.

351
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:32.800
He promises he'll be found.

352
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.040
And in my experience, he keeps his promises.

353
00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:36.440
Amen.

354
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.000
And if you're listening, we truly are praying

355
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:39.400
for you.

356
00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.960
Your questions aren't a roadblock.

357
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.320
They might just be the road itself.

358
00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.640
Faith isn't a performance.

359
00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.580
It's a relationship.

360
00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.860
It's a journey that often starts with that

361
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.260
raw vulnerability, that single brave knock.

362
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.020
It's about being met in the middle of

363
00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.600
your doubt, just like Thomas was.

364
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.280
Dr. James, thank you for sharing your journey.

365
00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.420
We started with doubt and ended with a

366
00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.020
Savior who never gives up on us.

367
00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.100
If this episode spoke to you, don't forget

368
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.000
to subscribe, share, and leave a comment.

369
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.400
And remember, God is not afraid of your

370
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:05.700
doubts.

371
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.020
He welcomes your questions, and he meets you

372
00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:08.740
