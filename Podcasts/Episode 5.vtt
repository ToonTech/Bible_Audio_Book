00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.000
Welcome back to Walking in His Footsteps, the

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.260
podcast where we explore how Jesus's life and

3
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.680
teachings can guide us through life's highs and

4
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.000
lows.

5
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.520
I'm Emma Thompson, your host, and today we're

6
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.700
tackling something so many of us face, anxiety

7
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.500
and depression.

8
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.080
In a world that's always on with social

9
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.840
media, work stress, and constant news, it can

10
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.860
feel overwhelming.

11
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.080
How can Jesus's words and example help us

12
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.820
find peace?

13
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.760
I'm joined again by Dr. Michael Carter, biblical

14
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.920
scholar and at St. Mary's University.

15
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.560
Dr. Carter, thanks for being back.

16
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.540
Emma, it's great to be here.

17
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.120
This is such an important topic, and I'm

18
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.180
glad we're diving into it with Jesus's wisdom

19
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.840
as our guide.

20
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.380
Me too.

21
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.500
I'm really looking forward to this deep dive.

22
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.160
You know, when we talk about peace in

23
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.880
this restless world, especially thinking about anxiety and

24
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.120
depression, it makes you wonder, did Jesus or

25
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.760
the Bible generally actually speak to these kinds

26
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.340
of deep emotional struggles, even if they didn't

27
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.660
use, well, our exact clinical words for them?

28
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.440
I mean, for so many people today, burnout,

29
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.920
that constant low level worry you get from

30
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.520
scrolling, feeling a bit lost, it's almost just

31
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.640
background noise now.

32
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.400
That's a really vital question to start with.

33
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.300
And what's fascinating is that while you're right,

34
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.420
the Bible doesn't use terms like clinical depression

35
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.240
or generalised anxiety disorder.

36
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.440
It absolutely speaks directly, powerfully to the core

37
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.700
human experiences behind those labels.

38
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.640
Think about the world Jesus lived in.

39
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.120
I mean, Roman occupation, crushing poverty for many,

40
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.480
real instability, people feeling powerless.

41
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.320
He knew the weight people carried.

42
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.280
He saw it every day.

43
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.620
Right.

44
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.480
It wasn't exactly a stress-free time.

45
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.020
Not at all.

46
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.700
So if we think about anxiety first, you

47
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.980
look at the Sermon on the Mount, Matthew

48
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.140
chapter six, Jesus says something like, don't worry

49
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.800
about your life, what you'll eat or drink

50
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.680
or your body, what you'll wear.

51
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.340
He points to the birds they don't sow

52
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.960
or reap, but God feeds them.

53
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.860
Aren't you much more valuable?

54
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.640
He asks.

55
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.840
Now for people living hand to mouth worrying

56
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.560
about the next meal, that wasn't just a

57
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.180
nice thought.

58
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.340
It was revolutionary.

59
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.900
Huge shift in perspective.

60
00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.740
Exactly.

61
00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.620
There was a call to fundamentally shift their

62
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.020
focus from scarcity and fear to, well, a

63
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.400
deep trust in God's provision.

64
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.380
That hits modern anxiety right where it lives,

65
00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.060
that gnawing fear about the future.

66
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.420
And what about those deeper feelings, the ones

67
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.920
closer to what we'd call depression, that heaviness?

68
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.840
Well, the Psalms are just filled with that

69
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.640
kind of raw, honest emotion.

70
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.580
Think about Psalm 42, verse 11, why my

71
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.560
soul are you downcast?

72
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.120
Why so disturbed within me?

73
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.460
It's not just a bad mood, that's deep

74
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.900
anguish, a soul feeling truly heavy, disturbed.

75
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.960
But what's key is the next line, put

76
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.800
your hope in God.

77
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.040
The Bible doesn't shy away from showing us

78
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.680
people feeling that depth of despair, but it

79
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.220
almost always points towards hope, towards trust, even

80
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.860
from the depths.

81
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.080
It validates the feeling and offers a way

82
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.440
forward.

83
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:43.100
Okay.

84
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.820
So the acknowledgement is there, the direction towards

85
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.940
hope is there, but practically speaking, when you're

86
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.780
really spiralling, when anxiety has its grip or

87
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.200
that depressive fog feels total, just hearing don't

88
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.660
worry or hope in God can feel, well,

89
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.060
almost impossible sometimes.

90
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.200
How do these teachings become something tangible, like

91
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.280
an anchor you can actually hold onto in

92
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.720
that moment?

93
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.700
That's the core challenge, isn't it?

94
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.440
And it's so important to say, Jesus' words

95
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.100
aren't meant as a magic spell.

96
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.440
It's not an instant fix.

97
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.340
What they offer is a framework.

98
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.340
A foundation, a truth to cling to when

99
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.800
everything else feels like it's shaking.

100
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.480
Jesus was incredibly realistic about life.

101
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.420
John 16.33, he tells his followers straight

102
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.280
up, in this world, you will have trouble,

103
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.240
no sugarcoating.

104
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.600
Right.

105
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.460
He didn't promise easy.

106
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.980
No, but then he immediately follows with, but

107
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.740
take heart, I have overcome the world.

108
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.020
So it's this pairing, acknowledging the real pain,

109
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.100
the real trouble, but anchoring it in a

110
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.540
greater hope, a bigger victory.

111
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.400
Sometimes just naming the pain as the first

112
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.900
step, right?

113
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.060
Not pretending it isn't there.

114
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.140
So acknowledging it, then what?

115
00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.280
Then engaging practically.

116
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.140
Philippians 4.6-7 gives such clear steps.

117
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.240
Do not be anxious about anything.

118
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.220
Okay, easier said than done, but then it

119
00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.680
says how?

120
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.020
But in every situation, by prayer and petition,

121
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.360
with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.

122
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.180
With thanksgiving, that part always strikes me.

123
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.260
It's crucial, isn't it?

124
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.680
It's not just bringing your worry list.

125
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.660
It's actively looking for, naming things to be

126
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.700
grateful for, even small things right in the

127
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.519
midst of the anxiety.

128
00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.720
It reframes things.

129
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.940
It shifts your focus.

130
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.320
And the peace of God, it continues, which

131
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.080
transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and

132
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.560
your minds.

133
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.780
That's the promise tied to that practise.

134
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.600
Have you seen that work for people in

135
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.720
a real life situation?

136
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.860
Oh, definitely.

137
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.780
I knew someone, let's call her Rachel, who

138
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.920
had terrible anxiety attacks, really debilitating.

139
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.300
She found something that helped her ground herself.

140
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.700
She got a little notebook, just a small

141
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.300
physical thing.

142
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.020
She wrote out verses like that one from

143
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.500
Philippians.

144
00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.260
When she felt the panic rising, she'd physically

145
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.980
pull out the notebook, read the words slowly,

146
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.080
breathe deeply, deliberately.

147
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.780
And then she'd actually speak her requests to

148
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.580
God, just like the verse says, trying to

149
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.380
also voice things she was thankful for.

150
00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.260
A physical anchor.

151
00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.860
Exactly.

152
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.460
Wasn't an overnight cure, not at all.

153
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.120
But she described it as her lifeline.

154
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.220
It gave her something solid to hold onto,

155
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.800
connecting her to God's peace when her own

156
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.740
mind felt chaotic.

157
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.720
It was that intentional act of engaging.

158
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.100
That makes so much sense, making it tangible.

159
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.140
Let's shift a bit to that other feeling

160
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.120
we mentioned, that heaviness, the stuck-in-a

161
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.300
-fog feeling of depression.

162
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.620
How does Jesus' own life or teachings speak

163
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.100
into that?

164
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.760
That's such a profound struggle.

165
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.540
And I think one of the most powerful

166
00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.080
things is seeing Jesus' own experience of deep

167
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.460
sorrow.

168
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.740
Think about the Garden of Gethsemane, right before

169
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.680
his crucifixion, Matthew 26.38. He tells his

170
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.020
closest friends, my soul is overwhelmed with sorrow

171
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.440
to the point of death.

172
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.900
Wow.

173
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.340
To the point of death.

174
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.420
That's not just sadness.

175
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.460
That's crushing agony.

176
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.800
It felt, to him, life-threatening.

177
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.600
But what did he do?

178
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.380
He prayed, but he also asked his friends

179
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.080
to start with him.

180
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.440
Exactly.

181
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.480
He turned to God, yes, poured out his

182
00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.740
heart.

183
00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.020
But he also reached out for human connection.

184
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.800
He didn't isolate himself in that immense pain.

185
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.540
He asked them to watch with him, to

186
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:04.080
be present.

187
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.500
That's a powerful model, because the instinct is

188
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.640
often to pull away when you feel like

189
00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.840
that.

190
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:09.520
It really is.

191
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.620
And it highlights how central community was for

192
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:11.920
Jesus.

193
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.280
He didn't just teach, he built a community,

194
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.640
a circle of support, people who shared life

195
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.860
together, the good and the bad.

196
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.580
So for someone battling depression, that might mean

197
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.000
finding that courage to reach out to a

198
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.880
friend, family, maybe a pastor or counsellor, crucially,

199
00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.120
maybe a mental health professional, someone to just

200
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.680
listen, to be there.

201
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.000
It connects to that idea of not carrying

202
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.640
it alone.

203
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.380
Precisely.

204
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.100
I think of another person, James.

205
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.540
He lost his job and just spiralled into

206
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.120
a really dark place, felt worthless, totally alone.

207
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.100
It took a lot.

208
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.820
But eventually, he went along to a small

209
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.440
group from his church and just sharing a

210
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.640
bit of his struggle over coffee, having people

211
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.420
listen without judgement, pray with him.

212
00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.160
He said it was like the fog slowly

213
00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.040
started to lift.

214
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.340
Community in action.

215
00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:56.720
Yes.

216
00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.840
It wasn't instant, but that consistent loving presence

217
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:00.820
made a huge difference.

218
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.040
It brings to life that invitation from Jesus

219
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.500
in Matthew 11.28. Come to me, all

220
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.040
you who are weary and burdened, and I

221
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.800
will give you rest.

222
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.220
James found that rest not just in private

223
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.040
prayer, but through people being the hands and

224
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.280
feet of Jesus, offering that compassion.

225
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.820
It's often both God and people working together.

226
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.160
That interplay is so important.

227
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.980
Okay, let's bring this right up to today.

228
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.720
The modern world throws so much at us,

229
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.160
the 24-7 news, social media constantly showing

230
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.360
curated perfection, this pressure to compare.

231
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.920
It feels designed to fuel anxiety and maybe

232
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.580
even depression.

233
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.240
How can Jesus' teachings help us navigate this

234
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.420
specific kind of noise?

235
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.700
That noise is very real, isn't it?

236
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.380
A relentless pressure.

237
00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.000
And while obviously, no smartphones in Jesus' time,

238
00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:44.940
his world wasn't quiet either.

239
00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.520
Think of the crowds, the political tension, the

240
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.340
constant demands.

241
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:48.740
True.

242
00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:50.780
Different noise, but still noise.

243
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:51.440
Exactly.

244
00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.000
And what did Jesus consistently model?

245
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.480
Withdrawal, intentional withdrawal.

246
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.980
Luke 5.1c says, Jesus often withdrew to

247
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.100
lonely places and prayed.

248
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.040
Often, not just once in a while.

249
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:03.320
Right.

250
00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:04.500
It was a regular practise.

251
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.780
For us, that speaks directly to the need

252
00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:07.740
to deliberately unplug.

253
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.260
Maybe it's an hour before bed with no

254
00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:10.660
screens.

255
00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.920
Maybe it's choosing a time for quiet reflection,

256
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.140
prayer, journaling, creating intentional pockets of silence to

257
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.760
counter the constant external buzz.

258
00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.380
Like building little sanctuaries in our day.

259
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:20.980
Precisely.

260
00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.060
And the other piece, especially with social media,

261
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.420
is where we get our sense of identity,

262
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.060
our worth.

263
00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.900
Social media often pushes us towards comparison, right?

264
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.220
Measuring ourselves by likes, followers, how perfect our

265
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.080
life looks online.

266
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:32.539
Definitely.

267
00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:33.200
It's a trap.

268
00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:34.000
It is.

269
00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:36.679
And Jesus offers a completely different foundation.

270
00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.880
In John 15.14, he says something remarkable

271
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:40.740
to his disciples.

272
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.300
I no longer call you servants.

273
00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.540
Instead, I have called you friends.

274
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.240
Friends, not just followers.

275
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.640
Friends, intimate companions.

276
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.640
Our value, our identity isn't based on performance

277
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.300
or popularity.

278
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.320
It's based on being known and loved by

279
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:55.760
God.

280
00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.580
That's a radical shift from the world's metrics.

281
00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.380
I remember Mia, a young woman really struggling

282
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.660
with that comparison trap online, feeling inadequate, anxious

283
00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:05.380
all the time.

284
00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.240
Her strategy wasn't to ditch social media entirely,

285
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.880
but she started a new habit.

286
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.220
Every morning, before she looked at her phone,

287
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.820
she'd read a chapter from one of the

288
00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:14.240
Gospels.

289
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:14.940
Oh, interesting.

290
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.020
Setting the tone first.

291
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:16.360
Exactly.

292
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.280
It was her way of reminding herself, first

293
00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.100
thing, who she was in God's eyes, not

294
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:20.960
in the eyes of her feed.

295
00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.980
She said it gave her a steadier foundation

296
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.320
for the whole day, rooted in God's love,

297
00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:26.940
not shifting online approval.

298
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.360
That's such a practical way to re-anchor

299
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:29.740
yourself.

300
00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.120
It really highlights finding that timeless value over

301
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.400
fleeting validation.

302
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.800
Okay, so for someone listening right now, maybe

303
00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.780
they feel really alone in their struggle, maybe

304
00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:42.320
hopeless.

305
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.500
It's exhausted.

306
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.520
What do you think Jesus's core message to

307
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.640
them would be right here, right now?

308
00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.000
Oh, I think first and foremost, it would

309
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.760
be compassion, deep compassion.

310
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.280
He always saw the hurting, the ones on

311
00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:54.700
the margins.

312
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.020
His heart would absolutely go out to them.

313
00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.660
And he'd want them to hear, truly hear

314
00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.760
and take in his words from John 10

315
00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.760
.10, I have come that they may have

316
00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.700
life and have it to the full or

317
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:06.300
abundantly.

318
00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.500
To the full, not just scraping by.

319
00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:08.960
Exactly.

320
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.740
He'd want them to know deep down that

321
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.580
they are seen, that God loves them right

322
00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.940
where they are, unconditionally, and that God desires

323
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.080
their flourishing, their wholeness, not just survival.

324
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.420
So what's a first step?

325
00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.600
If someone feels that way, what's one small

326
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.400
thing they could do?

327
00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.920
Maybe just one small manageable step.

328
00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.320
Perhaps it's taking the huge leap of courage

329
00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.080
to tell one trusted person how they're really

330
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:28.440
feeling.

331
00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.120
A friend, family member, a pastor, a therapist,

332
00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.240
just breaking the isolation.

333
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.300
Yeah, saying it out loud.

334
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.480
Or it might be praying the simplest, most

335
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.360
honest prayer, even just Jesus help me, that's

336
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:39.680
enough.

337
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.200
Or maybe quietly reading Psalm 23, the Lord

338
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.080
is my shepherd.

339
00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.380
Even though I walk through the darkest valley,

340
00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:48.500
I will fear no evil for you are

341
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:48.960
with me.

342
00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.640
Just letting that truth of God's presence soak

343
00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.080
in, knowing you're not alone, even in the

344
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:54.360
valley.

345
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.140
That image is so powerful, not instantly lifting

346
00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.920
you out, but being with you right there

347
00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.580
in the darkness, that changes everything.

348
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.600
If you were to leave us with just

349
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.280
one final thought, one core takeaway about finding

350
00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.980
peace amid anxiety or depression through Jesus's teachings,

351
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:09.880
what would it be?

352
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.200
I think it would be this, lean into

353
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.300
his promise of presence.

354
00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.780
Really lean into it.

355
00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.960
He knows, he understands the struggle, the fear,

356
00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:17.420
the pain.

357
00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.040
And he gave us that incredible unwavering promise

358
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.940
in Matthew 28, right at the very end.

359
00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.300
Surely I am with you always to the

360
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.000
very end of the age, always.

361
00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.820
So whether your journey towards peace involves more

362
00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.440
prayer or digging into scripture or finding that

363
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.340
vital support in community or taking an incredibly

364
00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:37.360
brave step of seeking professional help, which is

365
00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.180
so important, know this, Jesus is walking with

366
00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.860
you every single step.

367
00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.100
You really, truly don't have to carry it

368

Wow.
