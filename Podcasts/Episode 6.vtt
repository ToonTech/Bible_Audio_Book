00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.840
(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) Welcome to Walking in His Footsteps, where we

2
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.060
dive into how Jesus's life and teachings can

3
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.580
change us in real, everyday ways.

4
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.880
I'm Emma Thompson, and today we're hearing stories

5
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.260
of people whose lives were turned around by

6
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.260
Jesus, each in a unique way.

7
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.500
Joining me is Dr. Michael Carter, biblical scholar

8
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.860
from St. Mary's University.

9
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.260
Dr. Carter, I'm excited for these stories.

10
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.000
What's in store?

11
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.400
Emma, it's great to be back.

12
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.560
Yeah, today we're looking at three lives, really.

13
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.780
Three people, their journeys took some, well, pretty

14
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.580
dramatic turns.

15
00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:33.760
They all bumped up against Jesus's teachings, you

16
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.900
know, not in a theoretical way, but like

17
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.440
right in the middle of their biggest messes.

18
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.020
So we'll see how things change for them.

19
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.840
Each story kind of shows a different side

20
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.720
of his love, his power.

21
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.420
I love that.

22
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.400
Sets the stage really well for something personal.

23
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.640
Okay, let's dive in.

24
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.700
Who's the first person, and what was their

25
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.240
journey like?

26
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.100
Okay, first up is Daniel.

27
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.360
Young guy.

28
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.680
He got tangled up in opioid addiction.

29
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.180
Really tough battle.

30
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.700
Wow.

31
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.400
And it wasn't like a choice he just

32
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.040
made one day.

33
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.739
It actually started after a sports injury, snowballed

34
00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:04.120
from there.

35
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.780
Right, that happens, sadly.

36
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.320
Yeah, and he just felt completely stuck, you

37
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.540
know?

38
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.740
That awful feeling of shame, helplessness, like there

39
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.360
was absolutely no way out of the cycle.

40
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.860
That sounds incredibly dark.

41
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.260
Yeah.

42
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.620
Suffocating, feeling caught like that.

43
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.360
Exactly.

44
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.340
Utterly trapped.

45
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.780
He felt totally alone in it.

46
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.600
Hopeless, really.

47
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.240
So where did things start to change for

48
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.380
him?

49
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.240
Well, he hit rock-bottom.

50
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.680
Found himself in a rehab centre, and it

51
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.680
was there, you know, in that place, a

52
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.660
chaplain shared a Bible verse with him, John

53
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.700
8.36. Okay.

54
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.900
It's where Jesus says, if the Son sets

55
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.240
you free, you will be free indeed.

56
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:43.060
Wow.

57
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.820
Free indeed, for someone feeling trapped.

58
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.280
Exactly.

59
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.140
Imagine hearing that.

60
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.320
It wasn't just a nice phrase.

61
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.540
It was like a radical promise, a lifeline.

62
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.420
A promise of freedom that goes deeper than

63
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.180
just the physical.

64
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.580
Yeah.

65
00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.860
Into the mind, the spirit.

66
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.400
Totally.

67
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.100
It hit him hard.

68
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.900
And Daniel, he just, he clung to that

69
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.800
promise, like with everything he had.

70
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.840
He started praying every day, not just for

71
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.520
strength to get through withdrawal, but for like

72
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.660
the mental power to break free from the

73
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.300
addictions hole.

74
00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.840
That makes sense.

75
00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:10.100
Yeah.

76
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.700
It's mental too.

77
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.460
Big time.

78
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.060
And he didn't stop there.

79
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.100
He found a faith-based recovery group, got

80
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.540
around other people who understood.

81
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.720
Ah, community.

82
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.680
That's so important.

83
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.060
Crucial.

84
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.660
So you have this internal thing, right?

85
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.640
Clinging to the promise, and then the external

86
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.820
support, people walking alongside him.

87
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.880
Yeah, that combination, internal belief and external support.

88
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.940
That feels key for real change.

89
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.280
It really is foundational.

90
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.560
And as he kept leaning in, you know,

91
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.680
into the verse, into the community, that freedom

92
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.280
started to become real for him.

93
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.260
You could see it happening.

94
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.940
You could.

95
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.900
It gave him hope, courage, that inner strength

96
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.220
he needed.

97
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.840
And the result, I mean, it's amazing.

98
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.140
Daniel's now two years sober.

99
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.780
Two years.

100
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:52.580
That's fantastic.

101
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.320
It really is.

102
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.740
And here's the incredible part.

103
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.460
He's now mentoring others, people still fighting addiction,

104
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.340
sharing his story, offering that same hope.

105
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.720
Wow.

106
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.960
That's truly powerful.

107
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.480
From the depths of addiction to actively mentoring

108
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.820
others.

109
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.460
That's a profound full circle moment.

110
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.360
Just incredible.

111
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.400
Really shows that transformation we're talking about.

112
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.620
Okay, who's next for us?

113
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.160
Next, let's talk about Ayesha.

114
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.740
Her story shines a light on something else

115
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:16.320
really heavy.

116
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.800
Loneliness, crippling loneliness.

117
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.840
Oh, I know that one.

118
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.140
So many people feel that.

119
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.440
Yeah.

120
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.320
Ayesha was a single mom, went through a

121
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.180
tough divorce, pouring everything into her two kids,

122
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.940
working long hours, just trying to keep it

123
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:32.440
all together.

124
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.900
The demands are huge.

125
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.320
Totally.

126
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.740
But even with all that effort, all that

127
00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.980
love for her kids, she felt, well, invisible.

128
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.880
Just completely isolated, always running, always responsible, longing

129
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:45.580
for connection.

130
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.560
That really resonates.

131
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.020
Loneliness is so real, isn't it?

132
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.280
Even when you're surrounded by people or responsibilities,

133
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.020
especially today, it's often this quiet struggle.

134
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.840
It really is.

135
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.320
And she got to this point of just

136
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.960
desperation.

137
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.980
One Sunday, she just sort of stumbled into

138
00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:59.460
a church.

139
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.220
Just wandered in.

140
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.760
Pretty much.

141
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.020
Maybe just needed a quiet moment.

142
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.520
Who knows?

143
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.000
But the message that day, it hit home.

144
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.600
The pastor was talking about Matthew 11 to

145
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.640
Anel 8, where Jesus says, come to me,

146
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.560
all you who are weary and burdened, and

147
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.500
I will give you rest.

148
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.800
Weary and burdened.

149
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.320
Wow.

150
00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:16.640
That must have felt like he was speaking

151
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.360
directly to her.

152
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.140
Exactly.

153
00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:21.120
Like words written just for her situation.

154
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.060
It was this incredibly gentle invitation.

155
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.740
A lifeline.

156
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.480
Just like for Daniel, but different.

157
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.080
Absolutely.

158
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.300
That promise of rest just cut through all

159
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.800
her exhaustion, the weight she was carrying.

160
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.300
So she started to pray, which was kind

161
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.000
of new for her.

162
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.480
Found some solace there.

163
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.100
But then she took another step.

164
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.980
A brave one.

165
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.540
She joined a small group at the church.

166
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:40.060
Okay.

167
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.620
So connecting with people.

168
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:42.080
Yeah.

169
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.840
And this wasn't just casual.

170
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
It became, well, it became like family for

171
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.200
her.

172
00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.300
Real support.

173
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.540
Practical help.

174
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.520
Emotional support.

175
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.500
Just people showing up.

176
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.300
That's just beautiful.

177
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.880
Finding not just spiritual rest, but that real,

178
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.260
tangible community.

179
00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.380
That sense of belonging everyone craves.

180
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.060
Exactly.

181
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.940
And Aisha says it herself.

182
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.440
That invitation to rest.

183
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:04.760
It brought her a peace.

184
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.560
A connection she'd never felt before.

185
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.380
It wasn't just about not being tired.

186
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.400
It was deeper.

187
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.360
Soul level rest.

188
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.800
Yeah.

189
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.440
Knowing she wasn't alone.

190
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.640
That she was seen, valued, loved.

191
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.820
Her story just really shows how Jesus meets

192
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.760
us right there in our isolation.

193
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.060
Offers that connection.

194
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.160
That hits home.

195
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.920
Loneliness is so real, especially today.

196
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.400
I love how Jesus's words were like a

197
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.180
lifeline for her.

198
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.200
All right.

199
00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.800
One more story.

200
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:29.380
Tell us about it.

201
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.820
Okay.

202
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.120
Our last story today is Carlos.

203
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.160
Carlos was a businessman.

204
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.440
Looks successful on the outside, you know.

205
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:37.880
Had all the stuff.

206
00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:38.120
Right.

207
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.180
The image of success.

208
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.680
Exactly.

209
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.760
But inside, he was wrestling with a tonne

210
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.180
of guilt.

211
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.600
Things he'd done in the past.

212
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.300
Cutting corners in business.

213
00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.580
Cheating on deals.

214
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.220
Hurting people along the way.

215
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.700
Oh.

216
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.580
So the success felt empty.

217
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.520
Totally empty.

218
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.120
It came at a huge cost to his

219
00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.520
integrity.

220
00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.480
And that just weighed on him constantly.

221
00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.340
Couldn't shake it.

222
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.500
Kept him up at night.

223
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.200
That classic paradox, isn't it?

224
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.960
External success just can't fill that internal void,

225
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.780
especially from guilt.

226
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:06.280
That's it.

227
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.660
Exactly.

228
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.160
Living under this cloud of regret.

229
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.360
Feeling unworthy despite everything he'd achieved.

230
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.440
Then a friend noticed something was off.

231
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:14.540
Didn't push.

232
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.060
Just gave him a Bible.

233
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.980
Simple gesture.

234
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.380
Yeah.

235
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.520
And Carlos, maybe out of curiosity, maybe just

236
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.300
tired of feeling awful, he started reading it.

237
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.660
Eventually, he got to Luke 15.

238
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:23.680
Oh, the prodigal son.

239
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:24.740
The prodigal son.

240
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.500
You know the story.

241
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.160
Son messes up badly.

242
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.000
Wastes everything.

243
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.000
Ends up ruined.

244
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:29.380
Right.

245
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.120
Hits rock bottom.

246
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.480
Yeah.

247
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.440
Decides to go home, expecting maybe just to

248
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.060
be a servant.

249
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.680
But the father.

250
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.160
Yeah.

251
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.980
The father sees him coming and runs to

252
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:38.100
him.

253
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.520
Welcomes him back with open arms.

254
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:40.340
Throws a party.

255
00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.700
Just pure joy and forgiveness.

256
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.380
That story is so powerful.

257
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.480
The father running.

258
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.820
It gets me every time.

259
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.020
That picture of grace.

260
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.960
It really is.

261
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.760
And Carlos, reading that, he saw himself.

262
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.760
Plain as day.

263
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.000
He was that wayward son.

264
00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.380
Recognised his own mistakes, his own wasted integrity.

265
00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:58.960
Wow.

266
00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.700
But crucially, he also felt, really felt, God's

267
00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.120
forgiveness through that story.

268
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.240
Through Jesus's words in the parable.

269
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.160
It wasn't about earning it.

270
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.560
It was just given.

271
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.320
Like the father running to the son.

272
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.180
Radical acceptance.

273
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:11.680
Totally.

274
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.780
And it just lifted this immense weight off

275
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:13.880
him.

276
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:14.760
He could finally breathe.

277
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:16.640
So how did that change things for him?

278
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.580
Like day to day.

279
00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.580
What did that forgiveness look like in action?

280
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.120
It wasn't just a feeling.

281
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.880
It really changed how he lived.

282
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.700
He started the difficult work of making amends.

283
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.440
Going back to people he'd wronged.

284
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.180
That takes courage.

285
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.200
A lot of courage.

286
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.120
And he committed to living differently.

287
00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:32.940
With integrity.

288
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.100
Rebuilding trust.

289
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.120
And he found this whole new purpose.

290
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.400
Not in making more money.

291
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.040
But in giving back.

292
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.500
Sort of volunteering his time and skills.

293
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:42.980
Amazing.

294
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:43.640
Yeah.

295
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.380
His story just perfectly shows that grace Jesus

296
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:46.820
offers.

297
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.720
That it reaches even those who feel totally

298
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.280
unworthy.

299
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.360
Offers a way back to peace.

300
00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:52.180
To purpose.

301
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:54.540
These stories are so profoundly different.

302
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.500
Daniel's addiction.

303
00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:56.960
Aisha's loneliness.

304
00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.360
Carlos' guilt.

305
00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.880
But like you said, they all point back

306
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.420
to Jesus meeting people right in their specific

307
00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:03.780
mess.

308
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:04.640
Right where they are.

309
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:05.900
So what ties these together?

310
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.640
What's the big takeaway from these very different

311
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.000
lives?

312
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:09.360
Yeah.

313
00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:09.900
You nailed it.

314
00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.940
The common thread absolutely is Jesus's transformative love.

315
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:13.680
It wasn't generic.

316
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:14.420
It was personal.

317
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.920
Each unique struggle met by a direct encounter

318
00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.180
with his love, his teachings.

319
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.680
Paul actually talks about this in Romans 12

320
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.340
.2. He says, be transformed by the renewing

321
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:24.960
of your mind.

322
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:25.960
Renewing of your mind.

323
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:26.580
I like that.

324
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:27.180
It's active.

325
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.120
It implies change starts inside.

326
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:29.980
Exactly.

327
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.340
It's not just surface level.

328
00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.000
It's a deep inner shift.

329
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.659
Changing how we think.

330
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.500
How we see ourselves.

331
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.100
The world.

332
00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:36.400
Right.

333
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.440
And when you look back at Daniel, Aisha,

334
00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.960
Carlos, you see that happening.

335
00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:44.320
For Daniel, it was a renewed mind about

336
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:44.960
who...

337
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.580
He was not an addict, but free.

338
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:46.960
Okay.

339
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.080
For Aisha, renewing her mind about her worth,

340
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.060
about belonging, breaking that isolation.

341
00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.900
And for Carlos, a renewed mind about his

342
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.180
past, his purpose.

343
00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.920
Moving from guilt to integrity and giving back.

344
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.820
It's Jesus's presence, his teachings, his love that

345
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:03.940
sparks that renewal.

346
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.040
So it's addressing the root issues, not just

347
00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:06.540
the symptoms.

348
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:07.900
The fear, the shame.

349
00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:08.460
Precisely.

350
00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.360
He steps right into those deep places.

351
00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.140
These stories, they just show Jesus isn't some

352
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.500
figure stuck in the past.

353
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.040
He's personal.

354
00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.040
He's present.

355
00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.900
He gets involved in our specific addiction, loneliness,

356
00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.000
guilt, whatever it is.

357
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.060
And he offers exactly what's needed.

358
00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.800
Freedom, rest, forgiveness.

359
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:26.620
He meets the need.

360
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.260
He meets the need.

361
00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.840
He offers himself, really, his love.

362
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.460
And it's available to anyone who looks for

363
00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:30.600
him.

364
00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.260
Ready to transform lives right now.

365
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.400
This deep dive really shows that, doesn't it?

366
00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:35.360
It really does.

367
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:36.680
That's truly beautiful.

368
00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.440
Thank you so much for sharing these incredible

369
00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:38.960
stories.

370
00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.160
They're such powerful reminders of hope, no matter

371
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.340
what someone's going through.

372
00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:45.140
Listeners, if you're inspired today, or maybe if

373
00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.540
you see yourself in Daniel, Aisha, or Carlos,

374
00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.460
remember these changes often started with just one

375
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:50.820
step.

376
00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:51.880
So maybe take a step.

377
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.220
Read a gospel.

378
00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:53.960
Try praying.

379
