(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) Welcome to Faith Illuminated, the podcast where we

2
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.100
dive deep into the heart of Christianity, exploring

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.540
Jesus, faith, and what it means to walk

4
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.760
with God in today's world.

5
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.680
I'm your host, Pastor Michael Reynolds, and I'm

6
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.640
thrilled to kick off our very first episode.

7
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.120
Here at Faith Illuminated, we're all about honest

8
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.580
conversations, rooted in Scripture, that inspire and challenge

9
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.100
us to grow closer to Christ.

10
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.000
Today, we're tackling a big question.

11
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.460
Who is Jesus?

12
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.320
Not just the Sunday school answer, but the

13
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.940
Jesus we meet in the Bible, in our

14
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.020
lives and in our hearts.

15
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.000
I'm joined by an incredible guest, Dr. Elizabeth

16
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.320
Harper, a biblical scholar and professor of New

17
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.920
Testament studies at Grace Seminary.

18
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.940
Dr. Harper has spent decades studying the life

19
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.000
and teachings of Jesus, and she's written books

20
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.720
like The Word Made Flesh, Christ and the

21
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.180
Gospels.

22
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.280
Elizabeth, welcome to the show.

23
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.100
Elizabeth Harper Thank you, Michael.

24
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.240
It's such a joy to be here.

25
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.780
I'm excited to dig into this topic.

26
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.620
It really is the foundation of everything we

27
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.600
believe as Christians.

28
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.220
Absolutely.

29
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.920
So, let's jump right in.

30
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.360
Elizabeth, when someone asks who is Jesus, where

31
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.060
do you even start?

32
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.660
I mean, it's a question that's both simple

33
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.260
and, well, profound, right?

34
00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:05.060
Elizabeth Harper It really is.

35
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.540
And I think, for me, the best place

36
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.100
to start is often the Gospel of John.

37
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.540
Right at the beginning, John 1 verses 1

38
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.040
and 2 tell us, in the beginning was

39
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.600
the Word, and the Word was with God,

40
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.300
and the Word was God.

41
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.020
He was with God in the beginning.

42
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.000
So, right away, John established that Jesus is

43
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.820
the Word, or Logos, as eternal, as divine,

44
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.860
as God himself.

45
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:21.600
Michael The Logos, yeah.

46
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.340
Elizabeth Harper Preexistent.

47
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.780
Exactly.

48
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.740
But then, just a few verses later, John

49
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.840
hits us with something stunning.

50
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.180
Verse 14, the Word became flesh and made

51
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.240
his dwelling among us.

52
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.860
This is the incarnation.

53
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.320
It's this incredible mystery, God taking on human

54
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.580
skin, entering into our world or experience, fully

55
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.160
God, yet somehow fully human.

56
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.800
Elizabeth Harper Fully human.

57
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.280
That part is sometimes harder to grasp, I

58
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.620
think, but so vital.

59
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.080
I remember being, oh, maybe 19, wrestling with

60
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.460
this huge theological concept.

61
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.920
Then I read John 11.35, just two

62
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.580
words, Jesus wept.

63
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.160
He's standing at the tomb of his friend

64
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.280
Lazarus, and he weeps.

65
00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.940
It just struck me so profoundly.

66
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.300
This wasn't some distant, unfeeling deity.

67
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.280
This was God experiencing human grief, human sorrow.

68
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.139
It made him real, relatable.

69
00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:09.320
Oh, absolutely.

70
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.760
That moment at Lazarus' tomb is incredibly powerful.

71
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.900
It perfectly encapsulates that dual nature we're talking

72
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.180
about.

73
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.320
You see his deep, genuine human empathy, his

74
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.100
sorrow alongside Mary and Martha.

75
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.020
He feels their pain.

76
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.640
But then, moments later, he calls Lazarus out

77
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.200
of the tomb.

78
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.340
You see his divine power over death itself.

79
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.960
Wow, yeah.

80
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.340
It's like Colossians 1 says, he is the

81
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.200
image of the invisible God, and yet he's

82
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.640
right there weeping with his friends.

83
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.900
Both things are true at the same time.

84
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.540
Fully God, displaying divine power, and fully human,

85
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.120
sharing in our deepest sorrows.

86
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.460
So it's not just this abstract idea, something

87
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.080
we see play out, but how do we

88
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.520
help people connect with that today?

89
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.620
Is Jesus just this cosmic figure, the logos,

90
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.180
the creator, or is he someone we can

91
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.340
actually relate to personally?

92
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.860
That's such an important question.

93
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.480
I think the Gospels constantly show us he's

94
00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.860
both.

95
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.180
Yeah.

96
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.980
He is the cosmic Christ, but he's also

97
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:02.640
deeply personal.

98
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.120
Think about the woman at the well in

99
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.680
John 4.

100
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.120
Oh, yes.

101
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.820
Great example.

102
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:06.400
Right.

103
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.400
Here's a woman who's an outcast, marginalized by

104
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.380
her community, multiple husbands, living with someone who

105
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.420
isn't her husband.

106
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.560
By all accounts, someone a religious teacher back

107
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.540
then might avoid.

108
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.100
Definitely.

109
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.980
Crossing several social boundaries there.

110
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.500
Exactly.

111
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.980
But Jesus doesn't avoid her.

112
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.680
He initiates the conversation.

113
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.980
He sees her, not just her past or

114
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.660
her reputation, and he speaks to her deepest

115
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.160
needs.

116
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.900
He says that amazing line, if you knew

117
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.360
the gift of God and who it is

118
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.100
that asks you for a drink, you would

119
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.500
have asked him and he would have given

120
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.620
you living water.

121
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.480
Living water.

122
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.200
He offers her something life-changing right there

123
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.240
in that personal encounter.

124
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.700
Yes.

125
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.400
He meets her right where she is with

126
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.600
respect and compassion and offers her true spiritual

127
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.080
life.

128
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.320
It's incredibly personal.

129
00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:51.340
It really is.

130
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.980
I remember counseling a woman once.

131
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.900
Let's call her Sarah.

132
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.320
She felt so defined by her past mistakes,

133
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.800
really weighed down by shame, couldn't seem to

134
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.980
connect with God, felt he was distant, judgmental.

135
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.800
And we spent some time in that story,

136
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.480
John 4, just reading it, talking about how

137
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.560
Jesus saw that woman.

138
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.140
And it was like a light bulb went

139
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.720
on for Sarah.

140
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.280
Seeing Jesus interact with a woman at the

141
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.560
well with such grace and understanding, it changed

142
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.320
everything for her.

143
00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.839
She started to see Jesus not as someone

144
00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:21.820
waiting to condemn her, but as someone who

145
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.660
understood her, saw her value and offered her

146
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.020
hope.

147
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.060
That personal connection made all the difference.

148
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.140
That's a beautiful illustration of it.

149
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.780
It really is.

150
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.700
I had a similar experience with a student,

151
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.660
let's call him David.

152
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.880
He came into my New Testament class with

153
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.380
this image of Jesus as primarily a judge,

154
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.440
stern, maybe a bit distant.

155
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.880
Okay.

156
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.280
Yeah.

157
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.200
Some people see him that way.

158
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.460
Right.

159
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.720
And he was struggling with that.

160
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.020
But then we studied Philippians chapter two, you

161
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.760
know, verses six through eight, where Paul talks

162
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.280
about Jesus, who being in very nature, God

163
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.440
did not consider equality with God, something to

164
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.620
be used to his own advantage.

165
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.800
Rather, he made himself nothing.

166
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.200
By taking the very nature of a servant.

167
00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.480
Exactly.

168
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.780
Being made in human likeness and being found

169
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.480
in appearance as a man, he humbled himself

170
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.340
by becoming obedient to death, even death on

171
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.740
a cross.

172
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.820
Studying that passage, seeing the humility, the sacrifice,

173
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.320
the downward mobility of God himself, it completely

174
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.720
shifted David's perspective.

175
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:16.780
From judge to servant.

176
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.380
Yes.

177
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.040
From a figure of pure authority to one

178
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.040
of incredible self-giving love and humility.

179
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.240
And that connected for him to Jesus as

180
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.520
savior.

181
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.680
You know, like first Peter 2.24 says,

182
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.960
he himself bore our sins in his body

183
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.700
on the cross so that we might die

184
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.040
to sins and live for righteousness.

185
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.920
It wasn't just a doctrine anymore.

186
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.300
It was seeing the heart of the one

187
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.120
who would humble himself that much for us.

188
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.360
It made Jesus personal, approachable and profoundly loving

189
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.940
for David.

190
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.540
That emphasis on humility and service, it really

191
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.740
counters the idea of a distant God.

192
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.380
It reminds me of another aspect of Jesus

193
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.060
that feels deeply personal, the invitation to rest.

194
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.840
I went through a really low point when

195
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.220
I was about 25, just felt overwhelmed, burned

196
00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.420
out, carrying so much.

197
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.260
And I stumbled across Matthew 11 verses 28

198
00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.740
to 30.

199
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.380
Come to me, all you who are weary

200
00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.340
and burdened, and I will give you rest.

201
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.060
Such comforting words.

202
00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.780
They really were.

203
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.740
Take my yoke upon you and learn from

204
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.440
me, for I'm gentle and humble in heart,

205
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.400
and you will find rest for your souls.

206
00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.460
For my yoke is easy and my burden

207
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.940
is light.

208
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.460
Reading that felt like personal invitation from Jesus

209
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.660
himself, not adding another burden, but offering relief,

210
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.340
offering rest for my soul.

211
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.720
That passage was honestly a turning point in

212
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.420
my own journey towards a deeper, more personal

213
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.340
relationship with him.

214
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.140
That's powerful.

215
00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.740
It really speaks to the deep need we

216
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.500
all have for rest, for peace, not just

217
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.200
physical, but that soul deep rest.

218
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.500
And it connects so well with another image

219
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.280
Jesus uses for herself, the Good Shepherd.

220
00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.960
I remember when my mother passed away several

221
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.580
years ago, it was a time of profound

222
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.080
grief, just deep sorrow.

223
00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.120
Well, I'm so sorry.

224
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:49.720
Thank you.

225
00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.120
And in that time, I found myself clinging

226
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.860
to Psalm 23, the Lord is my shepherd.

227
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.260
I shall not want.

228
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.120
Yeah, a classic.

229
00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.620
Right.

230
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.380
That image of God as the gentle, guiding,

231
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.480
protecting shepherd, it brought so much comfort.

232
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.980
And then thinking about Jesus in John 10,

233
00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.200
where he explicitly says, I am the Good

234
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.480
Shepherd, the Good Shepherd lays down his life

235
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.160
for the sheep.

236
00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.720
Takes that familiar image and applies it directly

237
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.120
to himself with that added layer of sacrifice.

238
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:18.760
Exactly.

239
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.780
It wasn't just an abstract Psalm anymore.

240
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.400
It felt like Jesus himself, the Good Shepherd,

241
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.860
who understands grief, who laid down his life,

242
00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.140
was walking with me through that valley.

243
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.660
Knowing him as the Good Shepherd, the one

244
00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.440
who guides and protects and even sacrifices, it

245
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.500
was and is deeply personal and sustaining.

246
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.140
Wow.

247
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:38.160
Thank you.

248
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:38.940
Thank you for sharing that.

249
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.000
That's incredibly moving.

250
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.880
It just highlights again, doesn't it?

251
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.220
Jesus isn't just one thing.

252
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.200
He's the eternal word and he weeps.

253
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.480
He's the cosmic Christ and he meets the

254
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.200
woman at the well.

255
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.920
He's the humble servant and the Good Shepherd

256
00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.700
offering rest.

257
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:51.020
Yes.

258
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:52.500
All of it together.

259
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.400
So as we draw towards the end of

260
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.360
our conversation today, if there's one key takeaway

261
00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.440
you'd want listeners to hold onto about who

262
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.440
Jesus is, what would that be?

263
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.200
Um, I think I'd say this.

264
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.100
Jesus is the God who came near.

265
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.380
Hebrews 4.5 puts it so beautifully.

266
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.340
For we do not have a high priest

267
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.020
who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses,

268
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.500
but we have one who has been tempted

269
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.580
in every way, just as we are, yet

270
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:17.480
he did not sin.

271
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.260
He understands you.

272
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:19.980
He gets it.

273
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.480
Your struggles, your joys, your temptations, your weaknesses.

274
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:23.540
He's been there.

275
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.600
He can empathize.

276
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.080
Completely.

277
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:26.220
He understands you.

278
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:26.780
He loves you.

279
00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.320
And he invites you to know him personally.

280
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.000
So my encouragement would be don't just rely

281
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.240
on secondhand information.

282
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.780
Start with the Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John,

283
00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:37.480
read them, pray through them, ask questions, and

284
00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.620
just let Jesus reveal himself to you through

285
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.919
his own words and actions.

286
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.419
That's wonderful advice.

287
00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.960
Open the book, open your heart and encounter

288
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.420
him there.

289
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.140
Thank you so much for joining us today.

290
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.840
Your insights have truly been a blessing.

291
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:49.920
It was my pleasure.

292
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:50.380
Truly.

293
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.320

Next week, we'll be talking about living out

304
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.760
our faith in a modern world, navigating some

305
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.720
of the challenges and opportunities we face today,

306

so don't miss it.

307

308
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:13.420
of Christ.

309
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:14.300
God bless.
