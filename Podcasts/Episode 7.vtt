(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) Welcome to Walking in His Footsteps, where we

2
00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.160
explore how Jesus's teachings guide us through life's

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.140
big questions.

4
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.060
I'm Emma Thompson, and today we're tackling something

5
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.340
I've always wondered about.

6
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.540
What's the deal with Catholics and Protestants?

7
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.600
They're both Christian, but what makes them different?

8
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.960
Here to break it down is Dr. Michael

9
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.760
Carter, biblical scholar from St. Mary's University.

10
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.820
Dr. Carter, thanks for joining us.

11
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.140
Emma, it's a pleasure.

12
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.160
This is a great topic.

13
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.340
There's a lot of history here.

14
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.000
But yeah, it all ties back to following

15
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.360
Jesus.

16
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.220
Let's dive in.

17
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.020
At the core, what's the main difference between

18
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.180
Catholics and Protestants?

19
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.760
How did this split even happen?

20
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.880
Yeah, great question.

21
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.060
You really have to go back to the

22
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.940
1500s to what we call the Reformation.

23
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.880
That's when figures like Martin Luther started questioning,

24
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.980
challenging some practises of the Catholic Church at

25
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:50.400
the time.

26
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.780
But the absolute core issue, the real fundamental

27
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.520
thing was about authority.

28
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.620
Authority, how so?

29
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.400
Well, for Catholics, authority comes from two main

30
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.420
sources, you could say.

31
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.620
It's the Bible, and it's the church's tradition,

32
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.120
the teachings handed down over centuries.

33
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.740
And the Pope is seen as the main

34
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.500
guide and interpreter of that tradition, along with

35
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.880
the bishops.

36
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.700
So Bible plus tradition, guided by the Pope.

37
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.320
Exactly.

38
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.520
But then Protestants, coming out of the Reformation,

39
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.820
really emphasised sola scriptura.

40
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.240
Sola scriptura, Latin for?

41
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.060
Scripture alone.

42
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.420
The idea is that the Bible is the

43
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.840
only ultimate authority for faith and practise.

44
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.720
Now both absolutely believe in Jesus's teachings, right?

45
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.160
Like John 3.1's theme, for God so

46
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.880
loved the world.

47
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.480
That's central to both.

48
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.140
But how they determine the truth, where that

49
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.520
ultimate authority lies, that's the key split.

50
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.920
Okay.

51
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.460
So Catholics have the Pope and tradition, and

52
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.600
Protestants stick to the Bible, that's a big

53
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.780
one.

54
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.080
What's another key difference?

55
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.360
Maybe something about how they worship or believe?

56
00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.980
Yeah, definitely.

57
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.560
Worship, and specifically sacraments, that's another major area

58
00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.180
where you see a difference.

59
00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.980
Like ritual.

60
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.060
Sort of, yeah.

61
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.260
Catholics see sacraments, and they recognise seven of

62
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:11.400
them, like baptism, Eucharist, confession, as actual channels

63
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.920
of God's grace, ways God directly gives grace

64
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.440
to people.

65
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.180
Seven, okay.

66
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.600
And the Eucharist, or communion, is really central.

67
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.540
They believe in the real presence.

68
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.280
Real presence.

69
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.900
Yeah, the belief that the bread and wine

70
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.920
during the mass actually become the body and

71
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.620
blood of Jesus.

72
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.140
It's not just symbolic for them.

73
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.460
Wow.

74
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.680
They point to verses like John 6, where

75
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.800
Jesus talks about eating his flesh and drinking

76
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.340
his blood.

77
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.520
Okay, unless you eat the flesh.

78
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.940
Got it.

79
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.720
So it's very literal, very profound for Catholics.

80
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.540
And Protestants, how do they see it?

81
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.000
Well, Protestants typically recognise just two sacraments, baptism

82
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.900
and communion, or the Lord's Supper.

83
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.560
Just two.

84
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.380
And communion is generally seen as symbolic.

85
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.440
It's a powerful remembrance of Jesus' sacrifice.

86
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.020
A remembrance?

87
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.820
Exactly.

88
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.860
Like when Jesus said in Luke 22, do

89
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.920
this in remembrance of me.

90
00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.720
So the focus is more on the act

91
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.580
of remembering and proclaiming his death.

92
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:01.160
Got it.

93
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.500
So Catholics see the Eucharist as literally Jesus,

94
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.380
while Protestants see it as a symbol.

95
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.340
That's pretty different.

96
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:10.500
What about salvation?

97
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.880
I've heard people say Catholics and Protestants disagree

98
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.840
on how you get to heaven.

99
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.560
That's definitely another crucial distinction.

100
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.260
A really core theological difference that came out

101
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.900
of the Reformation.

102
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.980
So how does it break down?

103
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.360
Well, the Catholic understanding is often summarised as

104
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.640
salvation through faith and works.

105
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.660
Faith and works, meaning?

106
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.880
Meaning, yes, faith in Jesus is essential.

107
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.700
It's the foundation.

108
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.480
But living out that faith through good deeds,

109
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.840
acts of love and charity, those are also

110
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.040
seen as necessary, guided by God's grace, of

111
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.240
course.

112
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.420
Like in Matthew 25, Jesus says, whatever you

113
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.820
did for one of the least of these,

114
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.560
you did for me.

115
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.580
So those actions matter for salvation.

116
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:48.120
Hmm.

117
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.480
Okay.

118
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.920
So faith plus living it out through actions.

119
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.560
Right.

120
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.680
Guided by grace.

121
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.720
Now, Protestants, especially in the Reformation traditions, put

122
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.480
the emphasis on solified.

123
00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.300
Faith alone.

124
00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.760
Exactly.

125
00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:59.440
Faith alone.

126
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.320
The belief is that you're saved by God's

127
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.360
grace purely through trusting in Jesus Christ, not

128
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.380
by anything you do.

129
00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:07.620
So works don't matter.

130
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.280
Well, it's not that they don't matter at

131
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.500
all.

132
00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.980
They're seen more as the result or the

133
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.820
evidence of genuine faith rather than the means

134
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:15.920
of earning salvation.

135
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.339
Ah, I see the distinction.

136
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.720
Yeah.

137
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.040
Like Ephesians 2 says, by grace you have

138
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.940
been saved through faith, not by works.

139
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.660
It's a gift you receive through faith.

140
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:25.100
Okay.

141
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.820
So both agree salvation is rooted in Jesus's

142
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:28.480
death and resurrection.

143
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.100
Absolutely.

144
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.700
But they emphasise different aspects of how we,

145
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.420
you know, respond to that gift.

146
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.080
Faith and works versus faith alone.

147
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.260
That's helpful.

148
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.540
Is there anything else big we should know?

149
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.980
Maybe something practical that affects how people live

150
00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:43.560
their faith?

151
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.760
Yeah, there is.

152
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.580
Another key difference is the role of Mary,

153
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.320
Jesus's mother, and the saints.

154
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.800
Okay.

155
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:50.720
Mary and the saints.

156
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:51.540
How does that differ?

157
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.360
Well, Catholics hold Mary in very high honour,

158
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.680
and they also venerate saints people recognised for

159
00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.260
their holiness.

160
00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:59.480
Venerate, meaning?

161
00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:00.580
They honour them.

162
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.280
And crucially, they believe you can ask Mary

163
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.800
and the saints to pray for you to

164
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.100
God.

165
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.900
They see them as intercessors.

166
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.700
Like asking a friend to pray for you.

167
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:09.800
Kind of, yeah.

168
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.860
But on a heavenly level, they might point

169
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.240
to passages like in Revelation, where saints offer

170
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.740
prayers.

171
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.240
Okay.

172
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.380
So practically, you'll see Catholics praying the rosary,

173
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.640
for instance, which involves prayers to Mary.

174
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.800
I have a Catholic friend, Sophia, who finds

175
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.780
real peace in that, asking Mary to talk

176
00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:27.580
to Jesus for her.

177
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:28.120
Interesting.

178
00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.660
And the Protestant view?

179
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.040
Protestants generally focus prayer directly to God for

180
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.620
Jesus Christ.

181
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.160
Directly.

182
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.460
Yeah.

183
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.640
They emphasise Jesus as the one mediator between

184
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.620
God and humanity.

185
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.020
Okay.

186
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.300
That's based on verses like 1 Timothy 2

187
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.100
.5. There is one mediator, Christ Jesus.

188
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.640
Right.

189
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.820
So they typically don't pray to Mary or

190
00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:47.980
the saints for intercession.

191
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.380
The focus is direct access to God through

192
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.880
Christ.

193
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.460
So less formal prayers, like the rosary maybe,

194
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.060
and more personal Bible study.

195
00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.000
Often, yeah.

196
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.480
A big emphasis on that personal relationship and

197
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.360
direct communication.

198
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.800
My friend James, who's Protestant, really finds connection

199
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.540
just diving into scripture himself.

200
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.060
Gosh, yeah.

201
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.100
So again, you see different approaches, different practises,

202
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.180
but both are ultimately seeking connection with Jesus,

203
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.600
right?

204
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.040
That's such a clear way to see it.

205
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.020
Different paths, same heart for Jesus.

206
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.340
Dr. Carter, what's the takeaway for us, whether

207
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.160
we're Catholic, Protestant, or just curious?

208
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.320
You know, I think the biggest takeaway, the

209
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.080
overarching message, really has to be about unity

210
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.720
in Christ.

211
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.280
Unity.

212
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.740
Yeah.

213
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.860
Despite all these differences we've talked about, authority,

214
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.060
sacraments, salvation, Mary and the saints, differences that

215
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.720
are real and sometimes significant.

216
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.980
Both traditions share that fundamental belief in Jesus

217
00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.200
Christ as Lord and Saviour.

218
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.380
That's the common ground.

219
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.280
Jesus himself prayed for his followers to be

220
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:46.500
one.

221
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.560
In John 17, he prays that they may

222
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.380
all be one.

223
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.220
So understanding these differences, it shouldn't be about

224
00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.240
saying who's right or wrong, but more about

225
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.460
fostering respect and maybe learning from each other,

226
00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.060
and ultimately just keeping Jesus at the centre,

227
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.840
loving like he called us to love.

228
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.640
That core faith is, I think, much stronger

229
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:06.740
than the things that divide.

230
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.440
Love that.

231
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.360
Dr. Michael Carter, thank you for making this

232
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.080
so clear and kind.

233
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.560
Listeners, if this sparked curiosity, talk to a

234
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.480
Catholic or Protestant friend, or check out the

235
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.120
Bible verses Dr. Carter mentioned, share this episode,

236
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.900
and join us next time for more on

237
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:19.660
walking with Jesus.

238
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.940
Until then, keep walking in his footsteps.
