00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.400
Welcome to Walking in His Footsteps, a podcast

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.080
where we dive into the life of Jesus,

3
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.140
his impact on the world, and how his

4
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.340
teachings can guide us today.

5
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.360
I'm your host, Emma Thompson, and I'm thrilled

6
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.160
to have you with us.

7
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.380
Today we're exploring how Jesus's life offers lessons

8
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.020
for our personal and professional lives and how

9
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.780
we can show compassion to those in need.

10
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.240
Joining me is Dr. Michael Carter, a biblical

11
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.600
scholar and professor of theology at St. Mary's

12
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.040
University.

13
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.820
Dr. Carter, thanks so much for being here.

14
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.340
Emma, it's a joy to be here.

15
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.700
I'm excited to talk about Jesus's life and

16
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.540
how his teachings still resonate so powerfully today.

17
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.580
Oh, I'm pumped for this.

18
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:33.600
Let's dive right in.

19
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.220
So just to start us off, maybe paint

20
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.320
a quick picture for us.

21
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.940
Who was Jesus fundamentally and why was his

22
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.680
life so significant, not just back then, but

23
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.180
why does it still matter so much now?

24
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.380
Well, fundamentally, we're talking about a Jewish man,

25
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.000
a carpenter from Nazareth.

26
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.820
This is first century Judea under Roman occupation,

27
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.900
which is an important context.

28
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.420
He started his public ministry around age 30.

29
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.640
And his focus, teaching about the kingdom of

30
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.960
God.

31
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.340
But it wasn't just abstract theology.

32
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.160
It was practical.

33
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.920
Very practical.

34
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.560
He healed people who were sick, brought comfort

35
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.780
to those suffering, and he called people to

36
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.380
love one another.

37
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.200
But the message itself, it was pretty radical

38
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.980
for its time.

39
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.900
How so?

40
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.820
What made it radical?

41
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.180
Think about it.

42
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.760
Love your enemies, care for the poor, the

43
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.340
outcasts, forgive, well, forgive endlessly.

44
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.620
These weren't exactly mainstream ideas in that or

45
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.360
even our society.

46
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.980
That's true.

47
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.940
It still feels countercultural today.

48
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.740
It really does.

49
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.200
And crucially, he didn't just teach these things.

50
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.440
He actually lived them out.

51
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.340
That authenticity, I think, was key.

52
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.880
So people saw him doing what he was

53
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.160
preaching.

54
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.600
Exactly.

55
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.960
People were drawn to him because he genuinely

56
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.560
saw them.

57
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.480
The people's society usually ignored the outcasts, the

58
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.520
broken, the ones considered unimportant.

59
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.860
He gave them dignity.

60
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.780
He saw their value.

61
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.500
Precisely.

62
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.460
And ultimately, his life, his death, and the

63
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.380
resurrection, that became the bedrock of Christianity.

64
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.360
And his teachings, that way of living, billions

65
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.960
of people today are still trying to figure

66
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.420
out how to live according to that example,

67
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.720
still shaping lives.

68
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.039
That idea of seeing people is powerful.

69
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.440
Can you share maybe a couple of stories

70
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.680
from the Bible that really show how Jesus'

71
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.240
love actually transformed someone's life?

72
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.500
Concrete examples.

73
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.380
Oh, absolutely.

74
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.520
There are so many, but two really stand

75
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.040
out, I think.

76
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.720
First there's Zacchaeus.

77
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.820
You find his story in Luke chapter 19.

78
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.780
Zacchaeus, he was the tax collector, right?

79
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:28.360
That's him.

80
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.780
A chief tax collector, actually, which meant he

81
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.800
was probably wealthy, but also deeply hated.

82
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.320
Tax collectors back then were often seen as

83
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.560
traitors, working for the Romans, and notorious for

84
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.420
cheating their own people.

85
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.600
So definitely an outcast.

86
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.060
Definitely.

87
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.580
And Jesus comes into town, Caracal, Zacchaeus is

88
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.600
short, so he climbs a tree just to

89
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.040
get a glimpse of Jesus over the crowd.

90
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.700
And Jesus, he stops, looks up, and basically

91
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.960
invites himself over to Zacchaeus' house for dinner.

92
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.960
Just like that.

93
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.060
No lecture first.

94
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.600
No lecture, no condemnation, just an invitation, an

95
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.540
act of sheer acceptance.

96
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.180
And this completely undoes Zacchaeus.

97
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.380
Right there, he stands up and declares he'll

98
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.340
give half his possessions to the poor and

99
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.360
pay back anyone he's cheated four times over.

100
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.940
Wow.

101
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.060
So it wasn't being shamed into it, but

102
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.220
being accepted that caused the change.

103
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.760
Exactly.

104
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.140
Jesus' love, his willingness to associate with him,

105
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.980
changed Zacchaeus' heart.

106
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.060
It wasn't just about modifying behaviour.

107
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.600
It was a deep internal transformation.

108
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:26.320
That's incredible.

109
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.640
What's the other story you mentioned?

110
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.200
The other one is the woman at the

111
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.300
well from John chapter four.

112
00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.720
This is another powerful encounter.

113
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.460
She was a Samaritan woman.

114
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.080
And Jews and Samaritans didn't mix, right?

115
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.740
Not at all.

116
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.220
There was deep hostility there.

117
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.060
Plus, her personal life was complicated.

118
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.460
The text suggests she was likely ostracised even

119
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.660
within her own community.

120
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.880
Jesus meets her at a well, initiates a

121
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.580
conversation, breaking multiple social taboos right there, talking

122
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.740
to a Samaritan, a woman alone in public.

123
00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.140
He just ignored the social rules.

124
00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.820
Completely.

125
00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.640
He talks with her, shows he knows her

126
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.060
story without judgement, and offers her living water,

127
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.220
which is really about offering her a new

128
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.760
kind of life, a spiritual life with real

129
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.680
purpose and dignity.

130
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:09.680
And what happened to her?

131
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.920
She's transformed.

132
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.580
She goes from being this marginalised figure, likely

133
00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.040
avoiding people, to running back to her village

134
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.320
and telling everyone about Jesus.

135
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.380
She becomes an evangelist, really.

136
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.020
So in both cases, it was about seeing

137
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.980
the person, offering dignity, and that led to

138
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:25.920
this huge change.

139
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.260
Yes.

140
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.220
Giving people dignity and hope.

141
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.320
Seeing their inherent worth.

142
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.140
That seems to be the catalyst for profound

143
00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.600
transformation in these stories.

144
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.120
That really makes you think about our own

145
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.660
relationships.

146
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.400
How can we, just ordinary people, bring that

147
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.740
kind of compassion into our daily lives?

148
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.340
At home, with friends, even maybe with strangers.

149
00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.080
That's the key question, isn't it?

150
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.840
And I think it starts simply, though it's

151
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.540
not always easy.

152
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.360
It begins with trying to see people the

153
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.700
way Jesus did, with compassion, trying to look

154
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.640
past labels or our own prejudices.

155
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.700
Seeing the person behind the situation.

156
00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.160
Exactly.

157
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.540
Remember Matthew 22.39, love your neighbour as

158
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.940
yourself.

159
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.280
The crucial part there is understanding who neighbour

160
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.700
is.

161
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.400
In Jesus' context, it wasn't just the person

162
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.960
next door.

163
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.080
It was broader than that.

164
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.680
Much broader.

165
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.440
It meant anyone you encountered, anyone in your

166
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.380
path, especially someone in need, even an enemy.

167
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.340
Okay, so how does that look practically?

168
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.840
At home, for instance.

169
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.020
Well, at home, it might mean really listening

170
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.940
to your family, putting down the phone, making

171
00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.280
eye contact, hearing what's behind the words, even

172
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.780
when you're tired or stressed.

173
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:31.980
Being truly present.

174
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.420
Yes.

175
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.700
And with friends.

176
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.880
It's about showing up during the hard times,

177
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.020
not just the fun times.

178
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.420
Being a consistent, supportive presence when they're struggling.

179
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.180
That makes sense.

180
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.700
Any examples maybe of how this plays out

181
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.800
with, say, neighbours or people we meet casually?

182
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.440
Sure.

183
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.440
Think about maybe an elderly neighbour who lives

184
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.840
alone.

185
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.840
Like there's this example of a woman named

186
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.160
Sarah.

187
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.060
She noticed her neighbour, a widow, seemed to

188
00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.880
be struggling to carry her groceries one day.

189
00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.280
Okay.

190
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.000
Instead of just a quick wave, Sarah started

191
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.740
intentionally checking in on her each week.

192
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.360
Sometimes bringing meals, sometimes just chatting for a

193
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.500
bit.

194
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.220
It wasn't a huge dramatic gesture.

195
00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.700
It was small, consistent, intentional acts of care

196
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.380
born out of seeing a need.

197
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:14.820
That's loving your neighbour.

198
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.240
It's about noticing and then choosing to act,

199
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.300
even in small ways.

200
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.820
Precisely.

201
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.520
Small, intentional choices inspired by that model of

202
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.960
compassion.

203
00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.900
Let's shift a bit to the workplace.

204
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.180
That can be a tough environment, sometimes competitive,

205
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:29.720
maybe even cutthroat.

206
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.260
How do Jesus's teachings, especially about humility, apply

207
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:34.580
there?

208
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.000
Can you really practise servant leadership at work?

209
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.780
It's definitely a challenge, but yes, absolutely possible

210
00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.840
and I'd argue needed.

211
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.920
One of the most striking examples is in

212
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.940
John chapter 13.

213
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.820
What happens there?

214
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.160
Jesus watches his disciples' feet.

215
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.960
Now you have to understand, this was a

216
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.620
job reserved for the lowest servant in the

217
00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.000
household.

218
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.720
It was dirty, humbling work.

219
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.520
And here's Jesus, their leader, their teacher, doing

220
00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:58.760
it.

221
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:00.100
Taking on the role of a servant.

222
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:00.600
Exactly.

223
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.440
And then he tells them basically, I've given

224
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.020
you an example.

225
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.460
You should do as I have done for

226
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:04.680
you.

227
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.400
He completely flips the script on leadership.

228
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.880
It's not about power over others, but about

229
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.100
using your position, whatever it is, to serve

230
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:12.460
others.

231
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.120
So servant leadership isn't just a nice idea.

232
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.140
It's modelled directly by him.

233
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:17.620
Directly.

234
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.800
And it applies whether you're the CEO or

235
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.580
just starting out.

236
00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:21.600
It's about humility.

237
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.700
There was an example of a CEO, Mark,

238
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.460
who made it a point to regularly work

239
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.140
shifts alongside his frontline retail staff.

240
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:28.800
Really?

241
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.060
What was the point of that?

242
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.420
To understand their reality, their challenges firsthand.

243
00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.080
He listened to them, genuinely valued their input,

244
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.180
gave them credit.

245
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.440
He fostered a culture where people felt seen

246
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.720
and valued, not just like cogs in a

247
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.100
machine.

248
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.480
That's servant leadership.

249
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.700
That's a great example.

250
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.140
But what if you don't have that kind

251
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:50.660
of authority?

252
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.180
Can you still practise this?

253
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:53.000
Oh, absolutely.

254
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.800
You don't need a title to serve.

255
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.440
You can serve by helping a coworker who's

256
00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.040
struggling with a project, offering encouragement, being honest

257
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.240
and ethical, even when it's difficult, maybe mentoring

258
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:03.920
someone newer.

259
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.220
It's about putting others' needs alongside your own

260
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.500
ambitions, fostering collaboration instead of just competition.

261
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.840
So it's a mindset, an approach, more than

262
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.540
just a position.

263
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.000
Yes.

264
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.300
It's about how you interact with and value

265
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.100
the people around you every day.

266
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.760
That leads naturally, I think, to another core

267
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.160
part of Jesus's message.

268
00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.860
Caring for the marginalised, the poor, the sick.

269
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.700
He seemed to have a special heart for

270
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:27.920
them.

271
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.000
He absolutely did.

272
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.400
It wasn't just a side note.

273
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.059
It was central.

274
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.919
Think about Matthew 25, verse 40.

275
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.320
That's a powerhouse statement.

276
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.299
Remind us what it says.

277
00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:37.960
Jesus says, truly, I tell you, whatever you

278
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.260
did for one of the least of these

279
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.140
brothers and sisters of mine, you did for

280
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:41.360
me.

281
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.840
He directly equates serving people in need.

282
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.740
The hungry, the thirsty, the stranger, the naked,

283
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.500
the sick, the prisoner, with serving God himself.

284
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.620
So caring for the vulnerable isn't just a

285
00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.500
nice thing to do.

286
00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.460
It's actually encountering God.

287
00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.740
That's the implication.

288
00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:58.840
It's a deeply spiritual act.

289
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.700
It's fundamental to faith in action.

290
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.540
He didn't just talk about charity.

291
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.800
He lived a life of radical compassion, reaching

292
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.540
out to those society pushed aside.

293
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.500
How do we translate that into our world

294
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:09.820
today?

295
00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.280
It feels like the needs are so vast.

296
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.500
They are vast.

297
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.380
But the principle remains the same.

298
00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.140
It can look like volunteering at a food

299
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.800
bank or a homeless shelter, donating clothes or

300
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.640
resources, visiting someone who's sick or lonely.

301
00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.820
But it can also mean advocating for justice,

302
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.360
working for systemic changes that address the root

303
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.300
causes of poverty or marginalisation.

304
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.600
So direct help and working for bigger change.

305
00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.300
Both are important.

306
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.680
I know someone, Lisa, who felt called to

307
00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.040
address homelessness in her community.

308
00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.260
She started a programme through her church offering

309
00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.280
job training and support.

310
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:41.580
That sounds challenging.

311
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.800
Incredibly challenging.

312
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.840
Lots of hard work, setbacks.

313
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.340
But she often said that seeing the resilience

314
00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.380
and potential in the people she was helping,

315
00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.620
seeing them find hope again, it completely transformed

316
00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.580
her own faith.

317
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.800
She felt she was meeting Jesus in them,

318
00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.620
just like Matthew 25 says.

319
00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:00.520
That's powerful.

320
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.720
But it also brings up that feeling many

321
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.240
of us have, wanting to help but feeling

322
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.360
overwhelmed, like, I don't have enough time or

323
00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.580
I don't have enough money.

324
00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.260
What difference can I really make?

325
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.100
The scale of need seems paralysing sometimes.

326
00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.320
That's such a common and understandable feeling.

327
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.100
It's easy to look at the world's problems

328
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.840
and just feel small, insufficient.

329
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:23.360
But here's the thing.

330
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.860
Jesus never asked any one person to solve

331
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:26.400
everything.

332
00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.860
He didn't expect us to fix the whole

333
00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:28.900
world single-handedly.

334
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:29.160
No.

335
00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.100
He asked us to be faithful with what

336
00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.080
we do have, however little it might seem.

337
00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.140
There's that story in Luke 21 about the

338
00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:36.140
poor widow at the temple.

339
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.680
The one who gave the two small coins.

340
00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:38.560
That's the one.

341
00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.080
While wealthy people were putting in large sums,

342
00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.640
she puts in two tiny copper coins, basically

343
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.600
all she had to live on.

344
00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.120
And Jesus points her out and says she

345
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.980
actually gave more than all the others.

346
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.280
Because she gave sacrificially out of her need,

347
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.440
not just her excess.

348
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.080
Exactly.

349
00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:55.200
It wasn't about the amount.

350
00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.160
It was about the heart, the willingness to

351
00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:57.540
trust.

352
00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:01.000
It shows that the value isn't necessarily in

353
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.680
the quantity of our contribution, but in the

354
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.440
spirit behind it.

355
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.060
So the takeaway is, don't let feeling like

356
00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.920
you don't have enough stop you from doing

357
00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:09.340
something.

358
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:09.880
Precisely.

359
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:10.680
Start small.

360
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.580
Buy that coffee for the person on the

361
00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:13.040
street corner.

362
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.420
Offer a genuine word of encouragement to someone

363
00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.020
who looks down.

364
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.260
Volunteer an hour if you can't volunteer a

365
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:18.660
whole day.

366
00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.300
Listen compassionately.

367
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:21.560
These things matter.

368
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:22.400
They create ripples.

369
00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:23.920
Small acts have value.

370
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.060
Immense value.

371
00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.400
And, you know, if you're feeling overwhelmed or

372
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.800
unsure where to start, the Bible encourages us

373
00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.860
to ask for guidance.

374
00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:33.760
James 1.5 promises that God gives wisdom

375
00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.140
generously if we ask.

376
00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:36.160
Pray about it.

377
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.020
Ask where you can best use the gifts

378
00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.360
and resources you do have.

379
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.640
That's really encouraging.

380
00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:41.580
Don't get paralysed.

381
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.300
Just start somewhere with the right heart.

382
00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:45.680
That's the essence of it.

383
00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:47.660
Be faithful with what's in front of you.

384
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:48.940
This has been so insightful.

385
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.180
Before we wrap up, if there was one

386
00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:54.380
core message, one big takeaway you'd want listeners

387
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.700
to hold on to from Jesus's life about

388
00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.660
living out this love every day, what would

389
00:11:58.660 --> 00:11:58.960
it be?

390
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.640
I think boiling it all down, it comes

391
00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.820
back to love in action.

392
00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.780
That phrase really captures it.

393
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.160
Jesus's life wasn't just about nice ideas or

394
00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:08.780
warm feelings.

395
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.420
It was love embodied.

396
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.460
Love made tangible.

397
00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:12.120
Yes.

398
00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:15.020
Love for God, certainly, but poured out intangible

399
00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.220
love for others, especially those who were hurting

400
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:17.820
or overlooked.

401
00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.820
He gave that famous new command in John

402
00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.620
13.34. What was that again?

403
00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.900
A new command I give you, love one

404
00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.020
another as I have loved you, so you

405
00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:27.880
must love one another.

406
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.000
That's the blueprint.

407
00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:30.720
It's about loving others with that same kind

408
00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.660
of sacrificial, compassionate, active love he demonstrated.

409
00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:34.920
As he loved us.

410
00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:35.900
That's a high bar.

411
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:36.740
It is.

412
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.120
We'll do it imperfectly, no doubt, but if

413
00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.340
we genuinely lean into that, if we try,

414
00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.100
even stumbling along the way, to let that

415
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.580
kind of love guide our actions, our relationships,

416
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.860
our choices, it changes us, and it really

417
00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.280
does start to change the world around us.

418
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.720
One act of love, one person at a

419
00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.680
time, it's incredibly powerful.

420
00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.440
That's beautiful.

421
00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.700
Dr. Michael Carter, thank you so much for

422
00:12:58.700 --> 00:12:59.400
this conversation.

423
00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.340
I'm already thinking about how to live this

424
00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:02.500
out in my own life, and I bet

425
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.380
our listeners are too.

426
00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.100
Folks, if you enjoyed this episode, share it

427
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:07.880
with a friend, and join us next time

428
00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.040
as we dig deeper into Jesus's parables and

429
00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:10.780
what they teach us.

430
00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.560
Until then, keep walking in his footsteps.
