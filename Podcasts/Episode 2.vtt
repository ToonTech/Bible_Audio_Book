00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.790
Welcome, welcome, welcome, faithful listeners and curious seekers

2
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:04.990
to The Unfolding Faith.

3
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.470
I'm your host, and I am absolutely thrilled

4
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.370
you're joining us for our very first episode.

5
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.350
Today, we're diving deep into a topic that

6
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.510
is foundational to everything we believe, the person

7
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.390
of Jesus Christ.

8
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.330
Many of us grew up with Sunday school

9
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.410
stories, gentle Jesus, meek and mild.

10
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.450
But what if there's so much more to

11
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.910
discover?

12
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.650
What if the real Jesus is more radical,

13
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.870
more challenging, and ultimately even more compelling than

14
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:29.810
we ever imagined?

15
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.230
To help us peel back those layers, I

16
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.650
am incredibly honored to introduce our very first

17
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.990
guest.

18
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.930
She is a brilliant mind, a respected scholar,

19
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.910
and someone who has dedicated her life to

20
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:40.950
understanding the scriptures.

21
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.390
Please welcome Dr. Evelyn Reid, a distinguished New

22
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.250
Testament scholar from the University of Durham.

23
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.010
Dr. Reid, thank you so much for being

24
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.210
here.

25
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.710
It's an absolute pleasure to be here.

26
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.490
Thank you for having me.

27
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.370
So let's just dive right in.

28
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.090
When you think about this idea, the Jesus

29
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.130
I never knew, what kind of comes to

30
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.670
mind first, maybe from the common oversimplifications that

31
00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:59.250
we often see?

32
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.010
Yeah, that's a great place to start.

33
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.950
I think one of the biggest ones really

34
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.850
is this tendency to see Jesus as purely

35
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.750
a spiritual teacher, sort of disconnected from his

36
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.370
time and place.

37
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.210
Right, like he was just floating above it

38
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.450
all.

39
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.970
Exactly, like a gentle sage, just offering nice

40
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.070
spiritual thoughts, but not really engaged with the

41
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.310
world.

42
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.430
But the historical reality, the scholarship really emphasizes

43
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.690
this, is that he was deeply, deeply rooted

44
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.290
in first century Jewish life.

45
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.050
Under Roman occupation, that's key, isn't it?

46
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.890
Absolutely key.

47
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.190
It was a turbulent, politically charged environment.

48
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.830
And his teachings, they weren't just abstract.

49
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.950
They had, well, profound social implications, even you

50
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.790
could say subversive ones for the people hearing

51
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:43.130
them then.

52
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.130
Okay, subversive.

53
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.350
That definitely goes beyond gentle Jesus, meek and

54
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.630
mild.

55
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.090
Can you give us an example, something specific

56
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.690
from his teachings that sounds maybe familiar, but

57
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.850
was actually quite radical in context?

58
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.210
Sure.

59
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.730
Well, let's take the Beatitudes, from the Sermon

60
00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.690
on the Mount in Matthew 5.

61
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.670
Mm-hmm, blessed are the- Right, like,

62
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.110
blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit

63
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.950
the earth, or blessed are the peacemakers, for

64
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.710
they shall be called children of God.

65
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.470
Now, we hear those and they sound, well,

66
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.950
lovely, very moral.

67
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.970
Yeah, aspirational.

68
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.330
Exactly.

69
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.590
But put yourself in that world.

70
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.590
Roman power is everywhere.

71
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.130
It's built on military might, on dominance, on

72
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.110
taking what you want.

73
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.310
And here's Jesus saying, blessed are the meek,

74
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.630
blessed are the peacemakers.

75
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.970
Well, that's incredibly countercultural.

76
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.690
So meek there, it didn't mean weak or

77
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.550
passive, like we might think today.

78
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.190
It was something else.

79
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.610
Precisely.

80
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.350
That's a common misunderstanding.

81
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.970
The Greek word, it doesn't imply spinelessness at

82
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:39.190
all.

83
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.510
Think more like power under control.

84
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.870
Humility, yes, but also a profound reliance on

85
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.670
God, not on your own strength or on

86
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.050
violence.

87
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.050
Ah, okay.

88
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.130
So it's a different kind of strength.

89
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.730
It really is.

90
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.390
It's strength found in dependence on God.

91
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.590
Contrast that with Rome's strength through legions and

92
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.930
force.

93
00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.670
For a Jewish audience, many hoping for a

94
00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.070
military Messiah to kick the Romans out, Jesus

95
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.830
saying the path to inheriting the earth, inheriting

96
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.230
God's kingdom is through meekness and peacemaking.

97
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.130
That would have been frankly baffling, maybe even

98
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.130
scandalous to some.

99
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.530
He's proposing a completely upside down kingdom compared

100
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.430
to the world's values.

101
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.130
Wow.

102
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.510
Okay.

103
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.390
That really does flip the script.

104
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.330
It makes you hear those familiar words very

105
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.730
differently.

106
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.270
Thinking about your own journey with this, was

107
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.610
there a particular moment or teaching of Jesus

108
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.870
that really reshaped your understanding?

109
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.470
Something that made you think, ah, this is

110
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.550
the Jesus I never knew.

111
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:32.130
Oh, definitely.

112
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.730
For me, and it's something that comes through

113
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.170
strongly in a lot of the analysis, it's

114
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.910
his interactions with people on the margins.

115
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.990
Specifically, the encounter with a Samaritan woman at

116
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.170
the well, John chapter four.

117
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.470
Okay.

118
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:44.190
The woman at the well.

119
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.250
Why that one particularly?

120
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.010
Well, you have to understand the context.

121
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.410
Jews and Samaritans, they despise each other.

122
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.630
Centuries of bad blood, religious disagreement, ethnic tension,

123
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.570
and women in that society, especially a Samaritan

124
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.010
woman and one with, let's say, a complicated

125
00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.610
past.

126
00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.390
She was about as low on the social

127
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.330
ladder as you could get.

128
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.310
So just talking to her was breaking rules?

129
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.210
Multiple rules, major social taboos.

130
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.290
First, he deliberately goes through Samaria, which devout

131
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.650
Jews often avoided.

132
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.209
Then he, a Jewish man, initiates a conversation

133
00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.550
with her, a Samaritan woman alone.

134
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:18.790
That was unheard of.

135
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:19.790
And he asked her for a drink.

136
00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:22.530
It would have made him- Ritually unclean,

137
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:23.930
according to the customs of the day.

138
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:24.190
Yes.

139
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.770
But he does it anyway, and it doesn't

140
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.210
stop there.

141
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.370
He engages her in this incredibly deep theological

142
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.650
conversation about worship, about living water, and then

143
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.410
he reveals himself to her.

144
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.570
He tells the Samaritan outcast that he's the

145
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.350
Messiah, not the religious leaders, not even his

146
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.850
closest disciples first in this instance, her.

147
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.390
That's astounding when you lay it out like

148
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.530
that.

149
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.990
It really is.

150
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.250
It shows his kingdom isn't about our human

151
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.730
categories, Jew or Samaritan, man or woman, righteous

152
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.010
or sinner, social standing.

153
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.650
None of that.

154
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:53.730
He cuts right through it all.

155
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:54.270
He sees her.

156
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.190
Sees the person.

157
00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.610
Sees the person, offers her dignity, truth, and

158
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.610
this living water, and they kick her.

159
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.950
It's her testimony, this marginalized woman's word that

160
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.750
leads her whole village to come and hear

161
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.970
Jesus, and many believe because of her.

162
00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.230
It's just a powerful illustration of radical inclusion.

163
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.210
He sees past the labels, past the sin,

164
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:15.850
to the person God loves.

165
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.430
Seeing beyond the labels, that feels incredibly relevant

166
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.690
for us today, doesn't it?

167
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.310
In a world so quick to categorize, did

168
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.210
this pattern of challenging the status quo, especially

169
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.150
the religious establishment, show up elsewhere?

170
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.790
Oh, constantly.

171
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:29.690
It's a major theme.

172
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.390
Jesus was always bumping up against the religious

173
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.630
authorities, not because he was anti-religion, I

174
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.810
don't think, but against hypocrisy, against rules that

175
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.010
had become more important than people, than God's

176
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.550
actual heart.

177
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.230
Right, like adding burdens to people.

178
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.710
Exactly.

179
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:44.350
Think about Mark 2.1 sick.

180
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.930
He says, It is not the healthy who

181
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.590
need a doctor, but the sick.

182
00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.730
I have not come to call the righteous,

183
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.450
but sinners.

184
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.750
That must have really irritated the leaders who

185
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.170
saw themselves as the righteous ones.

186
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.950
Absolutely.

187
00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.810
Their focus was often on maintaining purity, on

188
00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.050
separation, on keeping things neat and tidy, clean

189
00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.410
versus unclean.

190
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.370
But Jesus' focus, it was on healing, on

191
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.510
restoration, on reaching out to the very people

192
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.610
the establishment wanted to keep out, eating with

193
00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.910
tax collectors, touching lepers, healing on the Sabbath.

194
00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:16.870
These weren't just nice gestures.

195
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.630
They were statements.

196
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:18.810
Powerful statements.

197
00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.730
Deliberate challenges to the system.

198
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.230
Showing God's compassion wasn't limited by their rules.

199
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.970
He was bringing wholeness where they saw only

200
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:27.550
defilement.

201
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.870
Okay.

202
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.430
So for someone listening now who maybe grew

203
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.130
up with that simpler picture and wants to

204
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.830
find this more radical, challenging, maybe more historically

205
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.490
real Jesus, what's a practical step?

206
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.250
How can they engage with the Gospels differently?

207
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.130
That's the crucial question, isn't it?

208
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.430
How do we rediscover this?

209
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.950
My biggest piece of advice would be read

210
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.170
the Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, as if

211
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.890
for the first time.

212
00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.230
Like wiping the slate clean.

213
00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:50.890
Exactly.

214
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.450
Try to consciously set aside the flannel graph

215
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.730
images, the Sunday school stories, the assumptions you've

216
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:55.970
carried.

217
00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.870
Maybe read one Gospel straight through from beginning

218
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.410
to end to really get its flow and

219
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:00.750
focus.

220
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.630
And as you read, pay really close attention.

221
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:05.390
Who does Jesus talk to?

222
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.570
What topics does he keep coming back to?

223
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.370
And maybe most importantly, how does he push

224
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.930
against the norms of his day?

225
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:14.970
Ask yourself, you know, how would this have

226
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.890
landed on a first century Jew?

227
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.370
Or what would a Roman soldier have thought

228
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:20.090
hearing this?

229
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:21.950
Approach it like a bit of a detective

230
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.430
maybe, looking for the surprising bits.

231
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:25.590
That's a great way to put it.

232
00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:26.210
Be a detective.

233
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.670
And don't shy away from the difficult parts,

234
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.250
the passages that make you uncomfortable.

235
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:33.910
Often that's where the depth is.

236
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:35.870
Can you give an example of a difficult

237
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:37.710
or maybe even fierce moment?

238
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:38.150
Sure.

239
00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.130
Think about Jesus turning over the tables in

240
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:42.010
the temple courtyard, John chapter 2.

241
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:44.290
That's not gentle Jesus, meek and mild.

242
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.530
That's fiercely prophetic.

243
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:49.410
It's an act of righteous anger against exploiting

244
00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:51.030
the poor and corrupting worship.

245
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:51.350
Right.

246
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:52.810
That's a powerful image.

247
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:54.070
Or even his rebuke of Peter.

248
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:57.070
His closest disciple says something trying to divert

249
00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:57.950
him from his path.

250
00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.590
And Jesus says, get behind me, Satan.

251
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:01.990
Matthew 16.

252
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:02.770
That's intense.

253
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:03.330
Yeah.

254
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.490
Not something you usually see on a greeting

255
00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:05.830
card.

256
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:06.750
Definitely not.

257
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:09.730
But these moments, they show a Jesus who

258
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:12.950
is fully human, feeling real emotions like anger

259
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:16.270
and frustration, but also fully divine, utterly committed

260
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:18.550
to his mission, even when it was incredibly

261
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:20.910
hard, even when it led to confrontation and

262
00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:22.330
ultimately to the cross.

263
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:25.590
It's a much richer, more complex and honestly

264
00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.050
more compelling picture than just the simplified version.

265
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:30.770
He's active, purposeful, challenging.

266
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.950
Dr. Reed, this has been an incredibly enlightening

267
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:34.530
conversation.

268
00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:36.650
We've just scratched the surface, but you've already

269
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.210
given us so much to think about and

270
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:39.169
to explore further.

271
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.549
Thank you for helping us begin to discover

272
00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:43.750
the Jesus beyond the familiar stories.

273
00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:44.490
My pleasure.

274
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:45.570
It's a journey worth taking.

275
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:47.070
And for all of you listening, I hope

276
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:49.770
this conversation has sparked a new curiosity, a

277
00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:52.070
desire to dig deeper into the gospels and

278
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:54.570
encounter the Jesus who is truly transformative.

279
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:57.270
Join us next time on The Unfolding Faith

280
00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.390
as we continue to explore what it means

281
00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.590
to believe in this rapidly changing world.
