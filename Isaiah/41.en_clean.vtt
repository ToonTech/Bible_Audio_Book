indeed you are nothing and your work is nothing he who chooses you is an

173
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010
nothing he who chooses you is an

174
00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.510
nothing he who chooses you is an abomination I have raised up one from

175
00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520
abomination I have raised up one from

176
00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.670
abomination I have raised up one from the north and he shall come from the

177
00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680
the north and he shall come from the

178
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.520
the north and he shall come from the rising of the Sun he shall call on my

179
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530
rising of the Sun he shall call on my

180
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.220
rising of the Sun he shall call on my name and he shall come against Prince's

181
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:05.230
name and he shall come against Prince's

182
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.980
name and he shall come against Prince's as though mortar as the potter treads

183
00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990
as though mortar as the potter treads

184
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.220
as though mortar as the potter treads clay who has declared from the beginning

185
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:11.230
clay who has declared from the beginning

186
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.190
clay who has declared from the beginning that we may know and former times that

187
00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.200
that we may know and former times that

188
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.690
that we may know and former times that we may say he is righteous surely there

189
00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:18.700
we may say he is righteous surely there

190
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.690
we may say he is righteous surely there is no one who shows surely there is no

191
00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:21.700
is no one who shows surely there is no

192
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.480
is no one who shows surely there is no one who declares surely there is no one

193
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490
one who declares surely there is no one

194
00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.690
one who declares surely there is no one who hears your words the first time I

195
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:27.700
who hears your words the first time I

196
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.410
who hears your words the first time I said to Zion look there they are and I

197
00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:31.420
said to Zion look there they are and I

198
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.170
said to Zion look there they are and I will give to Jerusalem one who brings

199
00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180
will give to Jerusalem one who brings

200
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.680
will give to Jerusalem one who brings good tidings for I looked and there was

201
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:37.690
good tidings for I looked and there was

202
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.560
good tidings for I looked and there was no man I looked among them but there was

203
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:40.570
no man I looked among them but there was

204
00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.930
no man I looked among them but there was no counselor who when I asked of them

205
00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940
no counselor who when I asked of them

206
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.280
no counselor who when I asked of them could answer a word

207
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.290
could answer a word

208
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.950
could answer a word indeed they are all worthless their

209
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960
indeed they are all worthless their

210
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.590
indeed they are all worthless their works are nothing they're molded images

211
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:51.600
works are nothing they're molded images

212
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.030
works are nothing they're molded images are wind and confusion

213
00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:55.040
are wind and confusion

214
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.559
are wind and confusion [Music]
