00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:21.669
the north facing the length which was

12
00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:26.130
the north facing the length which was 100 cubits the width was 50 cubits was

13
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140
100 cubits the width was 50 cubits was

14
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.999
100 cubits the width was 50 cubits was the north door opposite the inner court

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:30.009
the north door opposite the inner court

16
00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.519
the north door opposite the inner court of 20 cubits and opposite the pavement

17
00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529
of 20 cubits and opposite the pavement

18
00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.430
of 20 cubits and opposite the pavement of the outer court was Gallery against

19
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440
of the outer court was Gallery against

20
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.790
of the outer court was Gallery against gallery and three storeys in front of

21
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800
gallery and three storeys in front of

22
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.730
gallery and three storeys in front of the chambers toward the inside was a

23
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:41.740
the chambers toward the inside was a

24
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.480
the chambers toward the inside was a walk 10 cubits wide at a distance of one

25
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:45.490
walk 10 cubits wide at a distance of one

26
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.730
walk 10 cubits wide at a distance of one cubit and their doors faced north now

27
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:50.740
cubit and their doors faced north now

28
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.070
cubit and their doors faced north now the upper chambers were shorter because

29
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.080
the upper chambers were shorter because

30
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.230
the upper chambers were shorter because the galleries took away space from them

31
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.240
the galleries took away space from them

32
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.510
the galleries took away space from them more than from the lower and middle

33
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520
more than from the lower and middle

34
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.750
more than from the lower and middle stories of the building while they were

35
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760
stories of the building while they were

36
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.910
stories of the building while they were in three storeys and did not have

37
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920
in three storeys and did not have

38
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.030
in three storeys and did not have pillars like the pillars of the courts

39
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040
pillars like the pillars of the courts

40
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.469
pillars like the pillars of the courts therefore the upper level was shortened

41
00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479
therefore the upper level was shortened

42
00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.660
therefore the upper level was shortened more than the lower and middle levels

43
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670
more than the lower and middle levels

44
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.569
more than the lower and middle levels from the ground up and a wall which was
