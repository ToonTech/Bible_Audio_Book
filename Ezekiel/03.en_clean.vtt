spirit entered me and set me on my feet

172
00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:38.129
spirit entered me and set me on my feet and spoke with me go shut yourself

173
00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139
and spoke with me go shut yourself

174
00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:41.760
and spoke with me go shut yourself inside your house and you O son of men

175
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770
inside your house and you O son of men

176
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.670
inside your house and you O son of men surely they will put roofs on you and

177
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680
surely they will put roofs on you and

178
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.760
surely they will put roofs on you and bind you with them so that you cannot go

179
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.909
bind you with them so that you cannot go out among them I will make your tongue

181
00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919
out among them I will make your tongue

182
00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.279
out among them I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth so that

183
00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289
cling to the roof of your mouth so that

184
00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:56.100
cling to the roof of your mouth so that you shall be mute and not be one to

185
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110
you shall be mute and not be one to

186
00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.949

open your mouth and you shall say to them thus says the Lord God he who hears

193
00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:12.699
them thus says the Lord God he who hears

194
00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:16.139
them thus says the Lord God he who hears let him hear and he who refuses let him

195
00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:16.149
let him hear and he who refuses let him

196
00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:22.020
let him hear and he who refuses let him refuse for they are a rebellious house

197
00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.030
refuse for they are a rebellious house

198
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:34.079
