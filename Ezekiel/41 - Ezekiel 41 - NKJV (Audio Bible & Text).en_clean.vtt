cubits on every side the side chambers

40
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.929
cubits on every side the side chambers were in three stories one above the

41
00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939
were in three stories one above the

42
00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.830
were in three stories one above the other thirty chambers in each story they

43
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840
other thirty chambers in each story they

44
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.289
other thirty chambers in each story they rested on ledges which were for the side

45
00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299
rested on ledges which were for the side

46
00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.959
rested on ledges which were for the side chambers all around that they might be

47
00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:24.969
chambers all around that they might be

48
00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:27.419
chambers all around that they might be supported but not fastened to the wall

49
00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:27.429
supported but not fastened to the wall

50
00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:30.899
supported but not fastened to the wall of the temple as one went up from story

51
00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909
of the temple as one went up from story

52
00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.929
of the temple as one went up from story to story the side chambers became wider

53
00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939
to story the side chambers became wider

54
00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.599
to story the side chambers became wider all around because they're supporting

55
00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:36.609
all around because they're supporting

56
00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:38.309
all around because they're supporting ledges in the wall of the temple

57
00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:38.319
ledges in the wall of the temple

58
00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:40.169
ledges in the wall of the temple ascended like steps

59
00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179
ascended like steps

60
00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:42.179
ascended like steps therefore the width of the structure

61
00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189
therefore the width of the structure

62
00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.639
therefore the width of the structure increased as one went up from the lowest

63
00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649
increased as one went up from the lowest

64
00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.550
increased as one went up from the lowest story to the highest by way of the

65
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560
story to the highest by way of the

66
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.269
story to the highest by way of the middle one I also saw an elevation all

67
00:01:51.269 --> 00:01:51.279
middle one I also saw an elevation all

68
00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:54.239
middle one I also saw an elevation all around the temple it was the foundation

69
00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:54.249
around the temple it was the foundation

70
00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:57.629
around the temple it was the foundation of the side chambers a full rod that is

71

of the side chambers a full rod that is

72
00:01:57.639 --> 00:02:01.139
of the side chambers a full rod that is six cubits high the thickness of the

73
00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149
six cubits high the thickness of the
