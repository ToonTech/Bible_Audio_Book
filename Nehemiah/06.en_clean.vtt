come to kill you."

90
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.790
come to kill you." And I said, "Should such a man as I

And I said, "Should such a man as I

92
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.390
And I said, "Should such a man as I flee?

93
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400
flee?

94
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.390
flee? And who is there such as I who would go

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.949
into the temple to save his life? I will not go in."

99
00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959
not go in."

100
00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.030
not go in." Then I perceived that God had not sent

101
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040
Then I perceived that God had not sent

102
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.670
Then I perceived that God had not sent him at all, but that he pronounced this

103
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680
him at all, but that he pronounced this

104
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.150
him at all, but that he pronounced this prophecy against me because Tobaya and

105
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160
prophecy against me because Tobaya and

106
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.949
prophecy against me because Tobaya and San Ballot had hired him. For this

San Ballot had hired him. For this

108
00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.869
San Ballot had hired him. For this reason he was hired, that I should be

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879
reason he was hired, that I should be

110
00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.990
reason he was hired, that I should be afraid and act that way and sin so that

111
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000
afraid and act that way and sin so that

112
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.630
afraid and act that way and sin so that they might have cause for an evil report

113
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640
they might have cause for an evil report

114
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.869
they might have cause for an evil report that they might reproach me.

115
00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879
that they might reproach me.

116
00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:59.430
that they might reproach me. My God, remember Tobaya and Sand Balot
