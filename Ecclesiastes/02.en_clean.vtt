00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650
my labor in which I had toiled under the

122
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.830
my labor in which I had toiled under the Sun because I must leave it to the man

123
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840
Sun because I must leave it to the man

124
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.590

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160
whether he will be wise or a fool yet he

128
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.640
whether he will be wise or a fool yet he will rule over all my labor in which I

129
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650
will rule over all my labor in which I

130
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.010
will rule over all my labor in which I toiled and in which I have shown myself

131
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020
toiled and in which I have shown myself

132
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:53.090
toiled and in which I have shown myself wise under the Sun this also is vanity

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.140
therefore I turned my heart and despaired of all the labor in which I

137
00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150
despaired of all the labor in which I

138
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.160
despaired of all the labor in which I had toiled under the Sun for there is a

139
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170
had toiled under the Sun for there is a

140
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.830
had toiled under the Sun for there is a man whose labor is with wisdom knowledge

141
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840
man whose labor is with wisdom knowledge

142
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.070
man whose labor is with wisdom knowledge and skill yet he must leave his heritage

143
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080
and skill yet he must leave his heritage

144
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.610
and skill yet he must leave his heritage to a man who has not labored for it this

145
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620
to a man who has not labored for it this

146
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.300
to a man who has not labored for it this also is vanity and a great evil for what

147
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.140
striving of his heart with which he has toiled under the Sun for all his days

153
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150
toiled under the Sun for all his days

154
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.270

161
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200
better for a man than he should eat and

162
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.320
better for a man than he should eat and drink and that his soul should enjoy

good in his labour this also I saw was

166
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.790
good in his labour this also I saw was from the hand of God for who can eat or

167
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800
from the hand of God for who can eat or

168
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.300
from the hand of God for who can eat or who can have enjoyment more than I for

169
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310
who can have enjoyment more than I for

170
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.700
who can have enjoyment more than I for God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy

171
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710
God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy

172
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.150
God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy to a man who is good in his sight but to

173
00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160
to a man who is good in his sight but to

174
00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.860
to a man who is good in his sight but to the sinner he gives the work of

175
00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870
the sinner he gives the work of

176
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.200
the sinner he gives the work of gathering and collecting that he may

177
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210
gathering and collecting that he may

178
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.770
gathering and collecting that he may give to him who is good before God this

179
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780
give to him who is good before God this

180
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:10.100
give to him who is good before God this also is vanity and grasping for the wind

181
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110
also is vanity and grasping for the wind

182
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.060
also is vanity and grasping for the wind you

183
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070
you

184
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.540
you [Music]
