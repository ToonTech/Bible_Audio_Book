2
00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:10.570
then I returned and considered all the oppression that is done under the Sun

and look the tears of the oppressed but

6
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.510
and look the tears of the oppressed but they have no comforter on the side of

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520
they have no comforter on the side of

8
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.599
they have no comforter on the side of their oppressors there is power but they

9
00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609
their oppressors there is power but they

10

12
00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.920
have no comforter therefore I praise the dead who were

13
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930
therefore I praise the dead who were

14
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.500
therefore I praise the dead who were already dead more than the living who

15
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510
already dead more than the living who

16
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.640
already dead more than the living who are still alive

17
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650
are still alive

18
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.570
are still alive yet better than both is he who has never

19
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:34.580
yet better than both is he who has never

20
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.049
yet better than both is he who has never existed who has not seen the evil work

21
00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059
existed who has not seen the evil work

22
00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.890

work a man is MV by his neighbor this

28
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.049
work a man is MV by his neighbor this also is vanity and grasping for the wind
