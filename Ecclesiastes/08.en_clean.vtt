time and judgments because for every

28
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.180

though the misery of man increases

32
00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.540
though the misery of man increases greatly for he does not know what will

33
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550
greatly for he does not know what will

34
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.120
greatly for he does not know what will happen so who can tell him when it will

35
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130
happen so who can tell him when it will

36
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.820
happen so who can tell him when it will occur

37
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830
occur

38
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.370
occur no one has power over the spirit to

39
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380
no one has power over the spirit to

40
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.609
no one has power over the spirit to retain the spirit and no one has power

41
00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619
retain the spirit and no one has power

42
00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.849
retain the spirit and no one has power in the day of death there is no release

43
00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:14.859
in the day of death there is no release

44
00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:17.969
in the day of death there is no release from that war and wickedness will not

45
00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979
from that war and wickedness will not

46
00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.239
from that war and wickedness will not deliver those who are given to it all

47
00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:21.249
deliver those who are given to it all

48
00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:25.289
deliver those who are given to it all this I have seen and applied my heart to

49
00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299
this I have seen and applied my heart to

50
00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.039
this I have seen and applied my heart to every work that is done under the Sun

51
00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049
every work that is done under the Sun

52
00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.020
every work that is done under the Sun there is a time in which one man rules

53
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030
there is a time in which one man rules

54
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.899
there is a time in which one man rules over another to his own hurt

55
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240
then I saw the wicked buried who had

56
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.389
then I saw the wicked buried who had come and gone from the place of holiness

57
00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399
come and gone from the place of holiness

58
00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.870
come and gone from the place of holiness and they were forgotten in the city

59
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880
and they were forgotten in the city

60
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.350
and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done this also is

61
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360
where they had so done this also is

62
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.359
where they had so done this also is vanity because the sentence against an

63
00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369
vanity because the sentence against an

64
00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.050
vanity because the sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily

65
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060
evil work is not executed speedily

66
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.999
evil work is not executed speedily therefore the heart of the sons of men

67
00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009
therefore the heart of the sons of men

68
00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.319
therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil though a

69
00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329
is fully set in them to do evil though a

70
00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:07.499
is fully set in them to do evil though a sinner does evil a hundred times and his

71
00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509
sinner does evil a hundred times and his

72
00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.370
sinner does evil a hundred times and his days are prolonged yet I surely know

73
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380
days are prolonged yet I surely know

74
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.380
days are prolonged yet I surely know that it will be well with those who fear

75
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390
that it will be well with those who fear

76
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.280
that it will be well with those who fear God who fear before him but it will not

77
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290
God who fear before him but it will not

78
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.979
God who fear before him but it will not be well with the wicked nor will he

79
00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989
be well with the wicked nor will he

80
00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.979
be well with the wicked nor will he prolong his days which are as a shadow

81
00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989
prolong his days which are as a shadow

82
00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.789
prolong his days which are as a shadow because he does not fear before God

83
00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799
because he does not fear before God

84
00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.270
because he does not fear before God there is a vanity which occurs on earth

85
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280
there is a vanity which occurs on earth

86
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.009
there is a vanity which occurs on earth that there are just men to whom it

87
00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019
that there are just men to whom it

88
00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.380
that there are just men to whom it happens according to the work of the

89
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390
happens according to the work of the

90
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.589
happens according to the work of the wicked again there are wicked men to

91
00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599
wicked again there are wicked men to

92
00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.050
wicked again there are wicked men to whom it happens according to the work of

93
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060
whom it happens according to the work of

94
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.800
whom it happens according to the work of the righteous I said that this also is

95
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810
the righteous I said that this also is

96
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.610
the righteous I said that this also is vanity

97
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730
so I commended enjoyment because a man

98
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.270
so I commended enjoyment because a man has nothing better under the Sun than to

99
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280
has nothing better under the Sun than to

100
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.300
has nothing better under the Sun than to eat drink and be merry for this will

101
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310
eat drink and be merry for this will

102
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.339
eat drink and be merry for this will remain with him in his labor all the

103
00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349
remain with him in his labor all the

104
00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.100
remain with him in his labor all the days of his life which God gives him

105
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110
days of his life which God gives him

106
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.350
days of his life which God gives him Under the Sun when I applied my heart to

107
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360
Under the Sun when I applied my heart to

108
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.960
Under the Sun when I applied my heart to know wisdom and see the business that

109
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970
know wisdom and see the business that

110
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.780
know wisdom and see the business that he's done on earth even though one sees

111
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790
he's done on earth even though one sees

112
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.740
he's done on earth even though one sees no sleep day or night then I saw all the

113
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750
no sleep day or night then I saw all the

114
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.740
no sleep day or night then I saw all the work of God but a man cannot find out

115
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750
work of God but a man cannot find out

116
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.380
work of God but a man cannot find out the work that is done under the Sun for

117
00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390
the work that is done under the Sun for

118
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.220
the work that is done under the Sun for though a man Labor's to discover it yet

119
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230
though a man Labor's to discover it yet

120
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.460
though a man Labor's to discover it yet he will not find it moreover though a

121
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470
he will not find it moreover though a
