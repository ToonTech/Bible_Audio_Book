high and a line of 12 cubits measured

98
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.150
high and a line of 12 cubits measured the circumference of each then he made

99
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160
the circumference of each then he made

100
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.210
the circumference of each then he made two capitals of cast bronze to set on

101
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220
two capitals of cast bronze to set on

102
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.670
two capitals of cast bronze to set on the tops of the pillars the height of

103
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680
the tops of the pillars the height of

104
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.590
the tops of the pillars the height of one capital was five cubits and the

105
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600
one capital was five cubits and the

106
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.630
one capital was five cubits and the height of the other capital was five

107
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640
height of the other capital was five

108
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.229
height of the other capital was five cubits he made a lattice Network with

109
00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239
cubits he made a lattice Network with

110
00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.570
cubits he made a lattice Network with Riis of chain work for the capitals

111
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580
Riis of chain work for the capitals

112
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.300
Riis of chain work for the capitals which were on top of the pillars seven

113
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310
which were on top of the pillars seven

114
00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.820
which were on top of the pillars seven chains for one capital and seven for the

115
00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830
chains for one capital and seven for the

116
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.550
chains for one capital and seven for the other capital

117
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560
other capital

118
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.250
other capital so he made the pillars and two rows of

119
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260
so he made the pillars and two rows of

120
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
so he made the pillars and two rows of pomegranates above the network all

121
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270
pomegranates above the network all

122
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.630
pomegranates above the network all around to cover the Capitals that were

123
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640
around to cover the Capitals that were

124
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.750
around to cover the Capitals that were on top and thus he did for the other

125
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760
on top and thus he did for the other

126
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.170
on top and thus he did for the other capital the Capitals which were on top

127
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180
capital the Capitals which were on top

128
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.330
capital the Capitals which were on top of the pillars in the hall were in the

129
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340
of the pillars in the hall were in the

130
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.950
of the pillars in the hall were in the shape of lilies four cubits the Capitals

131
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.960
shape of lilies four cubits the Capitals

132
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.440
shape of lilies four cubits the Capitals on the two pillars also had pomegranates

133
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450
on the two pillars also had pomegranates

134
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.500
on the two pillars also had pomegranates above by the convex surface which was

135
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510
above by the convex surface which was

136
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.620
above by the convex surface which was next to the network and there were 200

137
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630
next to the network and there were 200

138
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.320
next to the network and there were 200 such pomegranates in rows on each of the

139
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330
such pomegranates in rows on each of the

140
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.250
such pomegranates in rows on each of the capitals all around then he set up the

141
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260
capitals all around then he set up the

142
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.650
capitals all around then he set up the pillars by the vestibule of the temple

143
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660
pillars by the vestibule of the temple

144
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.960
pillars by the vestibule of the temple he set up the pillar on the right and

145
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970
he set up the pillar on the right and

146
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.110
he set up the pillar on the right and called its name jaqen and he set up the

147
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120
called its name jaqen and he set up the

148
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.240
called its name jaqen and he set up the pillar on the left and called its name

149
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250
pillar on the left and called its name

150
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.630
pillar on the left and called its name Boaz the tops of the pillars were in the

151
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640
Boaz the tops of the pillars were in the

152
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.510
Boaz the tops of the pillars were in the shape of lilies so the work of the

153
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520
shape of lilies so the work of the

154
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.410
shape of lilies so the work of the pillars was finished and he made the see

155
00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420
pillars was finished and he made the see

156
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.100
pillars was finished and he made the see of cast bronze ten cubits from one brim

157
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110
of cast bronze ten cubits from one brim

158
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.880
of cast bronze ten cubits from one brim to the other

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.960
to the other it was completely around its height was

161
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970
it was completely around its height was

162
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.020
it was completely around its height was five cubits and a line of thirty cubits

163
