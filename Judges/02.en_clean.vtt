through them I may test

172
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.660
through them I may test Israel whether they will keep the ways

173
00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670
Israel whether they will keep the ways

174
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.940
Israel whether they will keep the ways of the Lord to walk in them as their

175
00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950
of the Lord to walk in them as their

176
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.070
of the Lord to walk in them as their fathers kept them or not therefore the

177
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080
fathers kept them or not therefore the

178
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.190
fathers kept them or not therefore the Lord left those nations without driving

179
00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200
Lord left those nations without driving

180
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.030
Lord left those nations without driving them out immediately nor did he deliver

181
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040
them out immediately nor did he deliver

182
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.730
them out immediately nor did he deliver them into the hand of Josh

183
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740
them into the hand of Josh

184
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:14.270
them into the hand of Josh you

185
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280
