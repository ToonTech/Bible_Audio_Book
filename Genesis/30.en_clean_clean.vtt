watering troughs where the flocks came

238
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.670
watering troughs where the flocks came to drink, so that they should conceive

239
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680
to drink, so that they should conceive

240
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.950
to drink, so that they should conceive when they came to drink.

241
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960
when they came to drink.

242
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.390
when they came to drink. So the flocks conceived before the rods,

243
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400
So the flocks conceived before the rods,

244
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.629
So the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth stre,

245
00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639
and the flocks brought forth stre,

246

speckled, and spotted.

248
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.870
speckled, and spotted. Then Jacob separated the lambs, and made

249
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880
Then Jacob separated the lambs, and made

250
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.350
Then Jacob separated the lambs, and made the flocks face toward the stre and all

251
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360
the flocks face toward the stre and all

252
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.230
the flocks face toward the stre and all the brown in the flock of Laban.

253
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240
the brown in the flock of Laban.

254
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.029
the brown in the flock of Laban. But he put his own flocks by themselves,

255
00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.039
But he put his own flocks by themselves,

256
00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:42.390
But he put his own flocks by themselves, and did not put them with Laban's flock.

257
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400
and did not put them with Laban's flock.

258
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.950
and did not put them with Laban's flock. And it came to pass whenever the

259
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960
And it came to pass whenever the

260
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.830
And it came to pass whenever the stronger livestock conceived that Jacob

261
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840
stronger livestock conceived that Jacob

262
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.830
stronger livestock conceived that Jacob placed the rods before the eyes of the

263
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840
placed the rods before the eyes of the

264
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.309
placed the rods before the eyes of the livestock in the gutters that they might

265
00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319
livestock in the gutters that they might

266
00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:55.189
livestock in the gutters that they might conceive among the rods.

267
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199
conceive among the rods.

268
00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:57.909
conceive among the rods. But when the flocks were feeble, he did

269
00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919
But when the flocks were feeble, he did

270
00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:00.870
But when the flocks were feeble, he did not put them in. So the feebler were

271
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880
not put them in. So the feebler were

272
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.350
not put them in. So the feebler were Labens and the stronger Jacobs.

273
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360
Labens and the stronger Jacobs.

274
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.430
Labens and the stronger Jacobs. Thus the man became exceedingly

275
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440
Thus the man became exceedingly

276
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.110
Thus the man became exceedingly prosperous and had large flocks, female

277
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120
prosperous and had large flocks, female

278
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.830
prosperous and had large flocks, female and male servants, and camels and

279
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840
and male servants, and camels and

280
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.840
and male servants, and camels and donkeys.
