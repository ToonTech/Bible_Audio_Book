19
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910
that I was by the river you lie then I

20
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.279
that I was by the river you lie then I lifted my eyes and saw and there

21
00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:42.289
lifted my eyes and saw and there

22
00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:45.779

standing beside the river was a ram

24
00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:49.750

were high but one was higher than the

28
00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:57.959
were high but one was higher than the other and the higher one came up last I

29
00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969
other and the higher one came up last I

30
00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.680
other and the higher one came up last I saw the RAM

31
00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690
saw the RAM

32
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.110
saw the RAM pushing westward northward and southward

33
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120
pushing westward northward and southward

34
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.800
pushing westward northward and southward so that no animal could withstand it nor

35
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810
so that no animal could withstand it nor

36
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.109
so that no animal could withstand it nor was there any that could deliver from

37
00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119
was there any that could deliver from

38
00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.830
was there any that could deliver from his hand but he did according to his

39
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840
his hand but he did according to his

40
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.139
his hand but he did according to his will and became great and as I was

41
00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149
will and became great and as I was

42
00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.039
will and became great and as I was considering suddenly a male goat came

43
00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049
considering suddenly a male goat came

44
00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.520
considering suddenly a male goat came from the West across the surface of the

45
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530
from the West across the surface of the

46
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.880
from the West across the surface of the whole earth without touching the ground

47
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890
whole earth without touching the ground

48
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.209
whole earth without touching the ground and the goat had a notable horn between

49
00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:34.219
and the goat had a notable horn between

50
00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:39.219
and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes then he came to the RAM that

51
00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229
his eyes then he came to the RAM that

52
00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.789
his eyes then he came to the RAM that had two horns which I had seen standing

53
00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799
had two horns which I had seen standing

54
00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.120
had two horns which I had seen standing beside the river and ran at him with

55
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130
beside the river and ran at him with

56
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.039
beside the river and ran at him with furious power and I saw him confronting

57
00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049
furious power and I saw him confronting

58
00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.819
furious power and I saw him confronting the RAM he was moved with rage against

59
00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829
the RAM he was moved with rage against

60
00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.969
the RAM he was moved with rage against him attack the RAM and broke his two

61
00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979
him attack the RAM and broke his two

62
00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.570
him attack the RAM and broke his two horns

63
00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580
horns

64
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.370
horns there was no power in the RAM to

65
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380
there was no power in the RAM to

66
00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.700
there was no power in the RAM to withstand him but he cast him down to

67
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710
withstand him but he cast him down to

68
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.359
withstand him but he cast him down to the ground and trampled and there was no

69
00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369
the ground and trampled and there was no

70
00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.910
the ground and trampled and there was no one that could deliver the RAM from his

71
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920
one that could deliver the RAM from his

72
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.430
one that could deliver the RAM from his hand

73
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440
hand

74
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.600
hand therefore the male goat grew very great

75
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610
therefore the male goat grew very great

76
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.570
therefore the male goat grew very great but when he became strong the large horn

77
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580
but when he became strong the large horn

78
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.290
but when he became strong the large horn was broken and in place of it four

79
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300
was broken and in place of it four

80
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.570
was broken and in place of it four notable ones came up toward the four

81
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580
notable ones came up toward the four

82
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.040
notable ones came up toward the four winds of heaven and out of one of them

83
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050
winds of heaven and out of one of them

84
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.530
winds of heaven and out of one of them came a little horn which grew

85
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540
came a little horn which grew

86
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.280
came a little horn which grew exceedingly great toward the south

87
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290
exceedingly great toward the south

88
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.650
exceedingly great toward the south toward the east and toward the glorious

89
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660
toward the east and toward the glorious

90
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.979
toward the east and toward the glorious land and they grew up to the hosts of

91
00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989
land and they grew up to the hosts of

92
00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.070
land and they grew up to the hosts of heaven and had cast down some of the

93
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080
heaven and had cast down some of the

94
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.170
heaven and had cast down some of the host and some of the stars to the ground

95

host and some of the stars to the ground

96
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.570
host and some of the stars to the ground and trampled them he even exalted

were taken away and the place of his

104
00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.069
were taken away and the place of his sanctuary was cast down because of

105
00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079
sanctuary was cast down because of

106
00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.340
