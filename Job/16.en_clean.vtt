with God as a man pleads for his

88
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.380
with God as a man pleads for his neighbour for when a few years are

neighbour for when a few years are

90
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.890

I shall go the way of no return

94
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:44.190
I shall go the way of no return [Music]
